<p class="center"><i>Translated from the Italian by</i>
</p>
<p class="center large">EDWARD STORER
</p>
<p>To this day the author of this famous collection of tales remains unknown. But he
probably was a minstrel of the Middle Ages who went from castle to castle entertaining
his listeners with his stories—Bible stories, stories from French, Provençal, and
Arthurian sources, stories from the Classics, and stories of Oriental origin. Some
were moralistic, some humorous, some witty, some spicy.
</p>
<p>As a collection they have never ceased to interest because of their humanness. Written
in a quaint simple style, they are full of action, wit, and wisdom, and represent
practically the oldest prose work in the Italian language.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One day about the end of the thirteenth century or the beginning of the fourteenth,
when the Middle Ages still darkly curtained the Renaissance from view, a “man of the
Court”, or minstrel, of some Italian lord had one of those inventive flashes which
go to the making of literatures. This “man of the Court” who was perhaps a minstrel
or <i>giullare</i> in little more than name—for his talent would be especially literary—knew by heart
the little archaic tales which make up the slender corpus of the <i lang="it">Cento Novelle Antiche</i>, or <i>Novellino</i>. Often he told them or heard them told in baronial halls, and in lordly places, in
rough huts after days of hunting, and in the encampments of battlefields. Before audiences
of seigneurs and knights, in the company of stately prelates, and in the rollicking
gatherings of dashing young <i lang="it">donzelli</i>, he had narrated or heard narrated by humbler men of his craft these simple <span class="pageNum" id="pb2">[<a href="#pb2">2</a>]</span>stories, some of them redolent of the wisdom of ages, others piquant with the flavour
of his own times. Well he knew their effect, and could choose one to suit his company
and occasion. Thus for the entertainment of graver and elderly lords he would select
those of monkish or ascetic origin, while when in the company of gay young <i lang="it">cavalieri</i>, he would not hesitate to tell over some of the more libertine tales of his oral
anthology. And the beginnings of the new Italian tongue, liberating itself from the
secular thrall of its parent Latin, and having taken shape in its Tuscan and Sicilian
matrixes, sought an early literary expression and found it in the work of our perhaps
slightly pedantic <i lang="it">giullare</i> who will in all probability remain for ever unknown to us. That some such person
existed is obvious, even if we cannot discover his name, nor his place of birth, nor
estate. He may indeed have been a worldly type of monk rather than a “man of the court”,
but the choice of the <i>novelle</i>, included in the collection, would certainly seem rather to point to the compiler
being a man of the world rather than an ascetic. As does the fact that the tales <span class="pageNum" id="pb3">[<a href="#pb3">3</a>]</span>were not written in Latin, for the tenacious Latin clung to the cloisters after it
had died on the tongues and pens of the lay world of those times. Our anthologist,
who was in fact a great deal more than an anthologist, had coadjutors and rivals,
successors and improvers, as the different manuscripts of the <i>Novellino</i> prove, but the original compiler of the <i lang="it">Cento Novelle Antiche</i>, as the work was previously called, was, one likes to believe, a single individual
rather than a group of <i lang="it">giullari</i> or ex-<i lang="it">giullari</i> at the dependence of some medieval Medici. So the idea came to him of grouping together
in one manuscript, which maybe he gave for copying to some Florentine monk, a selection
of the knightly, moral, Biblical, classical, and popular tales which were most in
vogue in his epoch. They were stories which had stood the test of time—some of them
the test of successive civilizations—and had met the full-throated approval of numerous
courts from Provence to Sicily, from Parma to Rome. Hitherto they had lived only on
the lips of the Court story-tellers and wandering minstrels who narrated them. The
tales which make up the <i>Novellino</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb4">[<a href="#pb4">4</a>]</span>were, for the most part, “taught”, as we learn from our text by one <i lang="it">giullare</i> or story-teller to another. And each man added or altered them according to his wit
and company. That the professional story-tellers played tricks with the tales in vogue
and added details and colour of their own on occasion, we may well presume from <i>Novella</i> LXXXIX, where a “man of the Court” is reminded that he is spinning out his story
at too great a length by one of the yawning company. The collection here printed under
the title of <i lang="it">Il Novellino</i>, most of which tales appear in the original edition of the <i lang="it">Cento Novelle Antiche</i>, by Gualteruzzi, formed part of a vast repertory of similar stories, legends and
anecdotes which were bandied about from province to province, from country even to
country, and closed full lived medieval days of hunting and of battle.
</p>
<p>Perhaps it was after some especially successful night when our unknown compiler had
won the approval of a generous <i lang="it">signore</i> for his tales, and carried off a purse filled with a few gold coins to his lonely
room, that the idea came to him of <span class="pageNum" id="pb5">[<a href="#pb5">5</a>]</span>framing the oral stories in a literary form. He had probably no notion that he was
making literature, or founding one of the purest early classics of the young Italian
tongue which the wit of the people had shaped out of the mother Latin. For him it
was a matter of convenience and utility, though the urge to give a literary shape
to the spreading idiom was in the air, deriving as an impellent necessity from the
propagation of the spoken word which was widespread in Tuscany and vigorous elsewhere
though in dialect forms. The first literary stirrings of the Italian conscience were
in the air, and writers brought up on Latin chronicles and used to the mixed French
and Italian of works like the <i lang="fr">Entrée en Espagne</i> of Nicola da Padua were anxious to try their hands on the wonderful virgin material
within their reach. We may reflect in passing what a marvellous opportunity it was
for poets and story-tellers, although they did not recognize it as such—to find themselves
in the privileged position of having a virgin language at their command, not debased
by the ready-made phrase, the trite mechanical expression. With a new language coming
into <span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>being, nothing or almost nothing is conventionalized. The idea runs straight from
the dynamic thought to the natural phrase. There are no ready-made channels to absorb
the spontaneity, convenient and inevitable as such moulds afterwards become.
</p>
<p>So our “man of the Court” dreamed upon his great idea, developed it, thought it over,
took counsel maybe of some tale-loving <i lang="it">signore</i> and set to work. We may, I think, fairly argue that it was some professional teller
of tales, some <i lang="it">giullare</i> of more than average education rather than any monk or ascetic who wrote the first
manuscript of the <i>Hundred Old Tales</i>, and this for the extremely free, not to say bawdy character of three or four of
them. (These latter have not been translated.) Moreover, the curious and often ridiculous
errors in geography, history, chronology and physics which we find in the <i lang="it">Novellino</i> is surely proof that the person who compiled it was no great scholar or man of learning.
The mistakes which appear in it could hardly have been perpetrated by a learned monk
well read in history and the classics. Again, Latin was still <span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>the language of science and such scholarship as existed then. The times were rude
in a certain sense, though perhaps less rude than is generally imagined, but some
of the errors to be found in the tales are so gross and absurd that they could not
have been committed to a manuscript by anyone of real learning. Which gives us ground
for believing that the original anthologist was of the minstrel class, a <i lang="it">giullare</i> of degree and some education, with literary yearnings, stimulated perhaps by the
exercises of his French and Provençal colleagues in the arts of story-telling and
song.
</p>
<p>Italian critics and writers generally on the subject of early Italian literature are
by no means agreed as to the origins of the tales which make up the <i lang="it">Cento Novelle</i>. It was during the latter half of the thirteenth century, however, that the new tongue
began to make headway against the obstinacy of the Latin, but it is only towards the
end of the thirteenth century that original works in Italian prose appeared. Before
the thirteenth century practically no Italian literature existed. Italian writers
had written in Latin, <span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>in French, and in a kind of mixed French and Italian. We have the Latin chronicles
of the IXth, Xth, XIth, and XIIth centuries which contain classical and mythological
allusions. Guido delle Colonne wrote his Trojan poem in Latin. In the <i lang="it">Bovo d’Antona</i>, the Venetian dialect makes itself clearly felt. It was from about the year 1250
that the national literature developed. In the North of Italy, the poems of Giacomino
da Verona and Bonvecino da Riva, which were religious in character, showed traces
of the movement which prepared the way for the instrument that was to serve Dante
and Boccaccio. In the South of Italy, and in Sicily especially, at the Sicilian court,
there arose a school of poets who specialised in love songs which were largely imitations
of Provençal rhymers. To this Siculo-Provençal school belonged Pier delle Vigne, Inghilfredi,
Jacopo d’Aquino and Rugieri Pugliese. The south of the Italian continent with the
exception of Naples and some monasteries like Salerno, was steeped in ignorance, and
rough dialects grew out of the Greco-Latin soil with nothing literary about them.
Frederick II <span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>himself, who ruled his Sicilian court, was a poet of sorts himself, though his productions
were imitative and unoriginal like most of the members of the Sicilian school. As
to what is exactly the oldest prose writing in the Italian language opinions differ,
but certainly the <i lang="it">Composizione del Mondo</i> by Ristoro d’Arezzo (a Tuscan) who lived about the middle of the thirteenth century,
is one of the oldest, if not the oldest. Matteo Spinelli da Giovenazzo, too, may lay
claim to be one of the very earliest writers in the Tuscan dialect, which afterwards,
and with great rapidity, developed into the Italian language. Another name that may
be mentioned is that of Ricordano Malespina.
</p>
<p>The French fabliaux, and the works of the French and Provençal singers and makers
of <i lang="fr">contes</i> certainly inspired writings like the <i lang="it">Novellino</i> and the few other contemporary works of a similar character. The former reached a
far higher degree of art than they ever attained to in Italy. To the extensive works
in thousands of lines which the other romance languages can show, Italy can only put
forward the bare skeleton tales of the <i lang="it">Novellino</i>, the <i lang="it">Conti dei Antichi Cavalieri</i>, <span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>the <i lang="it">Conti Morali del Anonimo Senese</i>. Earlier works there were in Latin, such as the famous <i>Gesta Romanorum</i> and the <i>Disciplina Clericalis</i>. Several of the tales which appear in the <i>Novellino</i> also figure in <i>Disciplina Clericalis</i> and in the <i>Gesta</i>, as we shall see.
</p>
<p>To all the poetry of the French and Provençal bards of the Middle Ages Italy has nothing
to oppose. <i>Cantastorie</i> or minstrels there were, but the Italian <i>giullare</i> was considerably lower in the hierarchy of song than his French or Provençal brothers.
In Italy such poems or songs lacked the profound impress of the people’s spirit. No
memory of these Italian songs has remained, though they must have existed, and perhaps
in plenty, but the versifiers of the period were plebian and lowly. They lacked the
protection of important courts. While France, Spain and Germany can show a rich epic
popular poetry, Italy can only boast a few hundred <i>novelle</i> in prose.
</p>
<p>The tale or <i>novella</i> was a literary product especially pleasing to the Middle Ages, which was, in the
matter of culture, an infantile age. The period seems to have almost a childish <span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>affection for the marvellous tale. Learning and intellectual sophistication of any
kind was in the hands of a few, was almost a kind of vested interest in which not
only the common people, but even the lords and knights themselves had no interest
or claim. This was especially the case in Italy, where no vehicle existed for its
propagation until the end of the thirteenth century. Therefore to simple minds, unused
to the mysteries of literature, save those written in a hermetic and pompous tongue
fast disappearing from common use, the tale was a spiritual refreshment aptly suited
to the time. In England, too, we see examples of Latin tales as in the <i lang="la">De Naturis Rerum</i> of Neckham.
</p>
<p>But if Italian culture was backward at this time, or non-existent save in Latin forms,
it grew very quickly, and from its plebian sources there came into being the new art
of Boccaccio. For though the language was new, the Italians were by no means a new
people. They had behind them a long uninterrupted literary tradition from which they
could with difficulty withdraw themselves. There was even a similarity of <span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span>spirit between those who clung to the old traditions and wrote in Latin, and the people
seeking to express themselves in their young language. The two literatures had a great
deal of the same spirit and character. The early Italian prose developed to a great
extent along the lines of the earlier chroniclers who wrote in medieval Latin. Nor
could it very well be otherwise, for even a new literature of a new tongue requires
models, and where should the new nationalist scribes turn for models save to the Latin
writings of their own countrymen? It is not too much to say that Italian grew quickly
because of its Latin traditions. It is astonishing to think how quickly it did grow,
from the simple beginnings of the <i>Cento Novelle</i> to Boccaccio. In less than one hundred years Dante is reached. This rapid growth
evidently depended on the fact that Italian was a continuation of Middle-Age Latin.
In its spoken form, it had been in use for some time, and it merely required a certain
amount of independence and belief in the popular idiom to turn it to literary uses.
</p>
<p>In the tales which make up the <i>Novellino</i>, <span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>we can see how near the form is to the spoken language, especially in those tales
which are of contemporary and local origin. The compiler did little more than put
into simple Tuscan prose tales that for the most part were well known in oral tradition.
When I come to examine the tales individually, we shall see which came from the classics,
which from Oriental sources, which from Provence and which were the product of local
wit.
</p>
<p>It is alleged in some quarters that the <i lang="it">Novellino</i> or the <i lang="it">Cento Novelle Antiche</i> was not the work of a single compiler. This thesis is supported by arguments which
point out the diversity of style and colour in the tales. It seems to me that it may
also be argued from this that, as indisputably the stories derive from many stories,
such as Provence, the Bible, the Greek and Latin classics, and the tales of the moral
and ascetic writers, such a variety of style and colour is only to be expected. If
one prefers the theory of single authorship—an authorship of course which is limited
as the subject matter of the tales was common property—one can find just as many arguments
for it as the <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>upholders of the plural authorship theory can lay against it. There are those who
deny the authorship of the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> to one poet. One cannot pretend to settle a question which still perplexes Italian
critics of their own early literature. One may, however, refer briefly to some of
the best accredited opinion on the subject.
</p>
<p>Francesco Costerò, who believes the tales to be written by several hands, writes in
his preface to a popular edition of the <i>Novellino</i>: “Nobody has yet, in spite of all the efforts of the learned, arrived at determining
for certain the time or authorship of the <i>Novellino</i>. This is very natural, in the case of a work which was obviously written by several
people and gathered in volume with time. In the <i>Novellino</i>, Saladin is spoken of, and we know that he died in 1193, during a war with the Christians
of the Third Crusade. The book also makes reference to the Cavaliere Alardo di Valleri,
who contributed to the victory of Charles d’Anjou at the battle of Tagliacozzo in
1268. From one date to the other there pass some seventy-five years, whence we should
have to admit that the author was more than a hundred <span class="pageNum" id="pb15">[<a href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>years old if he were one and the same person. Further, we must take account of the
style of the book”. This argument of Costerò does not seem very difficult to answer.
</p>
<p>Some people are of the opinion that Brunetto Latini was the author of some of the
tales and Professor Carbone writes that: “Latini added some of the finest flowers
of the collection and the two narratives of Papirius and the Emperor Trajan are to
be found with slight differences in the <i lang="it">Cento Novelle</i> and in <i lang="it">Fiore di Filosofi e di molti Savi</i>”.
</p>
<p>To give an idea of the close similarity that exists between the two versions of the
Trajan tale, I give a translation of both versions and place them side by side. The
Trajan story is No. LXIX of the present collection. The version to be found in the
<i lang="it">Fiore di Filosofi</i> runs:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><i>Trajan was a very just emperor. Having one day mounted his horse to enter into battle
with his cavalry, a widow woman came before him, and taking hold of his foot, begged
him very earnestly and asked him that he should do justice on those who had wrongfully
killed her son, a most upright <span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span>lad. The Emperor spoke to her and said: I will give you satisfaction on my return.</i>…</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>The version in the <i>Novellino</i> runs:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><i>The Emperor Trajan was a most just lord. Going one day with his host of cavalry against
his enemies, a widow woman came before him, and taking hold of his stirrup, said:
Sire, render me justice against those who have wrongfully killed my son. And the Emperor
answered: I will give you satisfaction when I return.</i></p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>As we see, the versions are almost identical, and the similarity continues in about
the same degree throughout the two versions of the same tale.
</p>
<p>The opinion has been put forward that Francesco da Barberino had a hand in the shaping
of the final collection of tales. This theory was advanced by Federigo Ubaldini in
1640. Adolfo Ancona, certainly one of the weightiest authorities on early Italian
literature, is of the opinion that the <i>Novellino</i> was the work of one man. The matter is complicated by the existence of more than
one manuscript.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span></p>
<p>The first edition of the tales was printed in Bologna in 1525 by Carlo Gualteruzzi
of Fano under the title <i lang="it">Le Ciento Novelle <span class="sic">antike</span></i>. In 1572, there appeared in Florence the <i lang="it">Libro di Novelle et di bel Parlar Gentile</i>, under the editorship of Monsignor Vicenzo Borghini. This latter edition differs
considerably from the Gualteruzzian version, contains tales which do not appear in
the earlier version and omits others contained therein. The discussions concerning
the two versions soon began. But the authenticity of the Gualteruzzian version is
now generally accepted, though the matter can by no means be considered as finally
settled. Borghini in his edition seems to have sought to remove from the text all
the moral and ascetic tales or those deriving from monkish or ecclesiastical sources.
According to D’Ancona, the version of Borghini is an altered and much edited one,
while the original edition of Gualteruzzi corresponds with the different codexes of
the work, except in the case of the Codex Panciatichianus Palatinus, which has recently
come in for accurate examination at the hands of Professor Sicardi, who has written
<span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span>a long essay prefacing his edition of the <i>Novellino</i>. Sicardi, it may be mentioned, holds by the theory of the plural authorship of the
tales. A curious fact in connection with the early editions of the <i>Hundred Old Tales</i> is that it has been alleged that an earlier edition than that of Gualteruzzi published
in Bologna in 1525 exists in England. It is supposed to have been offered for sale
by a London dealer in first editions, and to have passed into private hands. I have
not been able to verify the truth of the existence or not of this alleged early edition.
</p>
<p>The manuscripts of the <i lang="it">Cento Novelle Antiche</i> are eight in number, and seven of them correspond with the <i lang="la">editio princeps</i> of Gualteruzzi. Only one, the Codex Panciatichianus, discovered by Wesselofsky, and
published by Biagi in 1880, differs materially, and contains some thirty tales and
proverbs which do not appear in either of the two principal editions of Gualteruzzi
or Borghini.
</p>
<p>The eight codexes are: the Codex Marciana, which is in Venice; the Vatican manuscript;
while the other six are in Florence. Of these, <span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>one is in the Laurentian library, three are in the Palatine section of the National
Library, while the remaining manuscripts are to be found in the Magliabechiana section
of the same institute.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>The tales contained in the <i>Novellino</i> divide themselves into sections. We have the Biblical stories founded on occurrences
related in the Old Testament, and generally containing inaccuracies and alterations
in the names and places of the characters referred to. This in itself, as may also
be argued in the case of some of the tales deriving from the Greco-Roman sources,
would seem to prove the popular origin of the collection. The unknown compiler took
the oral story as he found it, even if it contained facts chronologically or historically
at variance with the Biblical narrative. We have an instance of this in story number
IV of the present collection, where, instead of the prophet Gad giving David the choice
of punishments, an angel is made to appear and tell David that he has sinned. Again,
in Novella XII, the compiler has mixed up the names of Joab and Aminadab, while in
Novella XXXVI, <span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>the account of the second half of the tale is not according to the Biblical narration.
</p>
<p>Another portion of the stories derive from French and Provençal sources and the Arthurian
cycle is drawn on more than once. The story of how “The Lady of Shalot died for love
of Lancelot of the Lake”, which is one of the most beautiful of the entire collection,
is an instance in point. The <i>Novelle</i> telling of the Lady Iseult and Tristan of Lyonesse, and the short one numbered XLV
are also from the Arthurian romance. Of probable Provençal origin are the tales concerning
the Young King and William of Borganda, the tale of Messer Imberal del Balzo, and
perhaps the two tales regarding Richard Cœur de Lion, as well as the story on the
Doctor of Toulouse, that about Charles D’Anjou and “What happened at the Court of
Puys in Provence”. Many of the tales are taken from French originals, such as those
dealing with the Astrologers of France, with Messer Roberto di Ariminimonte (LXII),
while it is possible that the stories dealing with the young King and Richard Cœur
de Lion came from the French and not the <span class="pageNum" id="pb21">[<a href="#pb21">21</a>]</span>Provençal. The <i>novelle</i> deriving from the knightly romances may also very well be of French origin.
</p>
<p>Another section of the tales would appear to have their origins in the classics, and
among these are the stories dealing with Trajan, Cato, Seneca, Socrates, Hector and
Troy, Narcissus, Hercules, Aristotle and others.
</p>
<p>A number are of oriental origin. Among these may be mentioned the <i>novella</i> treating of Prester John, of “the Greek kept in prison”, “How a jongleur lamented
before Alexander”, “God and the Minstrel” and the last one in the book about the Old
Man of the Mountain.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>As the reader will see, the stories in this collection, which represent what is the
oldest or almost the oldest work in prose in the Italian language, and the first book
of stories in that tongue, have a very special and characteristic style of their own.
Their language is the language of the beginnings of a culture, simple to the point
of bareness, full of action, wisdom and wit. The narratives are the narratives of
a man unused to <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>word-spinning and still a mediæval person of action, a trifle afraid of the mystery
of the written word, though probably almost a pedant in comparison with the illiterate
world of his time. The language of the tales calls to mind very obviously the style
of the Bible, or of the early Hellenic poems, though it is ruder than either. The
very simplicity which is one of the charms of the narrative has its drawbacks or rather
surprises, especially to modern minds accustomed to a more flexible and more elastic
syntax. The personal pronouns have a curious way of getting mixed up in the <i>Novellino</i>. One feels that the story-teller has a perfect, even childish confidence in the reader’s
interest, and as a matter of fact, the tales are so short and easily grasped that
the doubt as to who is the particular “he” or “she” or “they” referred to is little
more than a pedantic one. I have only altered these peculiarities of the prose where
it has seemed necessary in order to allow the meaning to come through clearly, for
certainly a great deal of the quality and charm of the book lies in its quaint style.
To smooth this out overmuch, would certainly destroy the vigour of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>original. Many of the tales, as I have said elsewhere, are common to many nations,
and it is largely due to the strong if abrupt style of the narratives that they give
us such a sharp sense of the period to which they belong.
</p>
<p>To read the tales in the present collection provides a remarkable contrast with modern
prose, which can never seem to say enough. The compiler or author, if so we may call
him, of the <i>Hundred Old Tales</i>, eschews all psychology the meaning of which word he was ignorant of, and abstains
from comment unless it be in the nature of moral comment. This latter, of course,
comes from the older tradition of Latin tales to which books like the <i lang="la">Gesta Romanorum</i> and <i lang="la">Disciplina Clericalis</i> belong. But in this case, the moral is pointed out out of respect to the older tradition,
from which the author could not quite shake himself free, writing, though he was,
in a new idiom. These moralisings which conclude some of the tales, or are allowed
to be understood, are more a tribute to the moral than the literary traditions of
the times.
</p>
<p>The beauty and dramatic effect of some of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>tales is extraordinary. The version given of the Lady of Shalot and how she died for
love of Lancelot is exquisite in its purity and tenderness. It is quite a little masterpiece
of literature.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“The sail-less vessel was put into the sea with the woman, and the sea took it to
Camelot, and drifted it to the shore. A cry passed through the court. The knights
and barons came down from the palaces, and noble King Arthur came too, and marvelled
mightily that the boat was there with no guide. The king stepped on to it and saw
the damsel and the furnishings. He had the satchel opened and the letter was found.
He ordered that it should be read, and it ran: ‘To all the Knights of the Round Table
this lady of Shalott sends greetings as to the gentlest folk in the world. And if
you would know why I have come to this end, it is for the finest knight in the world
and the most villainous, that is my Lord Sir Lancelot of the Lake, whom I did not
know how to beg that he should have pity on me. So I died for loving well as you can
see’.”</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>It would be hard to surpass the pure simplicity <span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>of this even in verse. The language moves directly from fact to the written word.
There is no hint of conscious colouring, no attempt to heighten the effect by a single
adjective. Adjectives indeed are extremely rare in the <i>Novellino</i>, as in all good simple prose for the matter of that. The writer rarely departs from
“very beautiful” or “most gentle” or “very rich”. As a rule, the tales are almost
adjectiveless, and never are adjectives used to round out an effect or disguise an
impoverished period. The rhythm of the tales, almost monotonous perhaps, yet wonderfully
strong, moves surely from subject to predicate with the least possible adornment.
Adornment, in fact, is not the word to use in this connection, for as such it does
not exist. Such adjectival or adverbial phrases as are used are such as are only strictly
demanded by the accompanying nouns or verbs. This, of course, is one of the characteristics
of good literature in all ages, and especially is to be found in early classic prose.
</p>
<p>A typical story of the Middle Ages is the dramatic, macabre tale of the knight who
was charged with the custody of a hanged man, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span>found a substitute for the body which had been taken away by the dead man’s friends
in the corpse of the husband of a woman to whom the knight makes love. The love scene
which takes place at night by the grave-side of the woman’s husband whom she is desperately
mourning is grim and picturesque indeed. We have to go to our own Border and Scotch
Ballads to find anything similar. Though the tale is of ancient origin, and is to
be found in Petronius, it has all the characteristics of awe, swift passion, gloom
and mockery which we associate with the so-called dark ages. The little story outlines
a drama of great gloom and power in a few rapid touches. The whole thing is told in
some three or four hundred words, but the content is packed with action, and not a
word is wasted in ornament or comment. If we take two or three of the lines of the
tale individually, we see how rich in action and picturesqueness they are, though
a chaster and more ascetic prose could hardly be used.
</p>
<p>“Do as I say,” says the knight at the graveside; “Take me to husband, for I have no
wife, and save my life, for I am in danger.… <span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>Show me how I may escape if you can, and I will be your husband and maintain you honourably.
Then the woman, hearing this, fell in love with the knight.… She ceased her plaint,
and helped him to draw her husband from his grave.…” We may note how in the next sentence
the writer passes quickly over what has happened on the journey to the scaffold, discarding
it as undramatic, for the same sentence goes on at once “… and assisted him to hang
him by the neck, dead as he was”.
</p>
<p>A modern story-teller would have filled several pages describing the lugubrious procession
in the heart of the night from grave-yard to scaffold, and have described at length
the feelings of the knight and the woman, with ample reflections on feminine nature;
while the stars, the countryside, black cypresses, notes of melancholy owls, the sentinels
at the city gates would all have been usefully dragged in to impress the reader.
</p>
<p>The Middle Ages was childish perhaps in its love of the marvellous and marvellous
stories, but the audiences of the old <i>giullari</i> and <i>jongleurs</i> certainly did not lack imagination. In this they <span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>were like children who are rich in it, and to whom a bare swift tale with sharply
outlined facts is dearer than all the considerations and artifices with which a clever
tale-teller may embellish it.
</p>
<p>If it is not correct to state that people to-day have less imagination than folk in
the Middle Ages, it is very likely true that as they have so many more calls on it,
it easily becomes tired and loses in elasticity. Those with lively imaginations like
to add a good deal themselves to a story that is told them, and such was the case
with the listeners to the stories given in this collection. They would probably have
resented the <i>guillare</i> overloading his narratives with subsidiary facts, descriptions and artificial holding
of the interest. They could do that kind of thing very well themselves. In fact, we
have internal evidence from the <i>Novellino</i> itself that lengthy stories were not to the taste of the listeners of those times.
In Novella No. LXXXIX, we read of a <i>giullare</i> “who began a story that never ended”. One of the hearers interrupts the story-teller,
and assures him that the person “who taught him the tale did not teach him all of
it”. The <i>giullare</i> <span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>ask why and is answered: “Because he did not teach you the end”.
</p>
<p>Some writers have put forward the theory that the stories contained in the <i lang="it">Cento Novelle Antiche</i> were only the synopses of longer stories, the index, so to speak of a much larger
book that has been lost. But it seems to me that for the considerations before mentioned
this is not the case. The <i>novella</i> in its infancy was always a brief narration, and even when we come to Boccaccio and
his wider manipulation of material, the tales even then are not long as we judge the
length of stories nowadays.
</p>
<p>Certainly the modern man who lives a much less physical existence than his forbears,
and has perforce to use his imagination and other intellectual faculties to a far
greater extent than did the elder folk, requires his stories completely filled in
so that they leave him little work to do. The Tired Business Man who takes the place
of the bold baron and the fat bourgeois of the old days exacts from his modern jongleurs
that they give him the least possible intellectual fatigue.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span></p>
<p>A number of the tales seem to belong especially to the period, and differentiate themselves
from the older ones in the collection where the monkish and Latin flavour clings still
through the freer prose of the new idiom. Many of them have quite a Boccaccio touch,
and already we seem to hear the round jovial laugh, the sensual yet humanistic mockery
of the great Florentine. Among these we may mention the story of the <i>Woman and the Pear-tree</i>, which is not to be found in the original Gualteruzzi edition of 1525, but comes
from the Panciatichiano MS. The picture of the two lovers up in the branches of the
pear-tree, while the blind husband clasps the trunk of the tree below is worthy of
the author of the <i>Decameron</i>. The ending of the story, however, seems to be more in keeping with the period.
</p>
<p>The curious dialogue between God and Saint Peter, blasphemous almost at first sight
and yet innocent in its curious naivete and simplicity, is the kind of thing we find
in our period. It is on a par with that other extraordinary story of God and the minstrel
who went partners together, which is obviously an old and favourite tale and <span class="pageNum" id="pb31">[<a href="#pb31">31</a>]</span>much in the style of the <i lang="it">duecento</i>. Borghini left it out of his edition, perhaps thinking it was offensive to religious
sentiment.
</p>
<p>Boccaccian is Novella No. XLIX, the story of the Physician of Toulouse, though the
tale would appear to come from the French. So too is the story about the parish priest
Porcellino, whose name is certainly chosen to give further point to the tale. In the
same category comes Novella LXII, the tale of Messer Robert of Burgundy. The story
in fact appears in the <i>Decameron</i>.
</p>
<p>Many of the narratives have quite a different character to this rich mirthful mockery.
Tales like that relating to Prester John, to the wise Greek whom a king kept in prison,
the “Argument and Sentence that were given in Alexandria”, Antigonus and Alexander,
the Land Steward who plucked out his own eye, belong to another epoch altogether and
form part of the monkish and ascetic heredity of the <i>Novellino</i>.
</p>
<p>A few (four or five) of the stories are frankly indecent, and are always expurgated
from popular editions of the work in Italy, a course <span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span>which I have followed here. Two or three of the present collection are also a trifle
free, but I have decided to leave them in their place, with a few unimportant excisions
and alterations.
</p>
<p>Another outstanding feature of the stories is the number of them which tell of smart
sayings, clever retorts and elegant ripostes. Evidently a great deal was thought of
such kind of quick-wittedness in the days of the <i lang="it">duecento</i>. The compiler in the Proem to the book lists his “fair courtesies and fine replies,
valiant actions and noble gifts”, though there are a number of tales dealing with
snubbing or sarcastic replies, which do not seem to be included in the category outlined
in the Proem.
</p>
<p>There is a certain curious childishness in the almost awed admiration which the compiler
seems to feel for anyone who makes a witty retort, or snubs an opponent neatly. It
is part of the intellectual simplicity of the time. Thus we have the answer of the
pilgrim to the Emperor in Tale LXXXVI, the answer of the man who went to confess himself
to the priest, the clever trick of the man who lent money to the student in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>“Man of the Marches who went to study at Bologna”.
</p>
<p>Great importance, too, is laid on the knightly virtues of kindliness, courtesy and
generosity; Knights were expected to be brave, but also gentle, in the sense which
the word has taken on when allied with the noun and transformed into our modern gentleman.
This common vocable of our daily life is a direct inheritance from the times of chivalry,
and retains in its best meaning a great deal of the old significance.
</p>
<p>In the language of the stories there is a good deal of Latin grace, order and sense
of measure due to the old tradition. For the tales in this collection passed in many
cases from their original Latin forms to the mouths of the people, taking on in the
process a new originality, character and colour before they were written again in
the virgin prose of Tuscany.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>That these little tales can please modern readers there is good reason to believe,
for they have been tested by time and worn smooth by repetition of all useless angles
or unnecessary <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>detail. There is in them as their especial merit great humanity, passion, drama, and
often a wisdom so old and mysterious that it seems to reach back through half a dozen
civilizations to the very heart and mind of early man.
</p>
<p>And so I close this note of introduction and open the way for the tales themselves
“for the use and delight of such as know them not and fain would know” as the compiler
says.

that the tongue speaks from the fulness of the heart.
</p>
<p>You who have gentle and noble hearts above other men, shape your minds and your words

before He created us, and before we ourselves loved Him. And if in certain ways we

</p>
<p>And since the noble and the gentle in their words and deeds are as a mirror for the
lower folks, for that their speech is more gracious, coming from a more delicate instrument,
let us call back to memory some flowers of speech, such fair courtesies and fine replies,
valiant actions and noble gifts as have in time gone by been compassed by many.

<p>So whosoever has a noble heart and fine intelligence may imitate in time to come,

<p>If the flowers of speech we offer you be mixed with other words, be not displeased,
for black is an ornament to gold, and a fair and delicate fruit may sometimes adorn

<h2 class="main">Of the rich embassy which Prester John sent to the noble Emperor Frederick</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Prester John,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1632src" href="#xd31e1632">1</a> most noble Indian lord, sent a rich and honourable embassy to the noble and powerful
Emperor Frederick, he who was in truth a mirror to the world in matters of speech
and manners, who delighted generally in fair speech and sought ever to return wise
answers. The substance and intention of that embassy lay in two things alone, to prove
at all hazards, if the Emperor were wise both in word and in act.
</p>
<p>So Prester John sent him by his ambassadors three most precious stones, and said to
the ambassadors: question the Emperor and ask him on my behalf to tell you what is
the best thing in the world. And take good notice of his answers and speech, and study
well his court and its customs, and of what you shall learn bring me word, omitting
nothing at all.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span></p>
<p>And when they came to the Emperor to whom they had been sent by their master, they
greeted him in a manner suitable to his majesty, and on behalf of their master, whom
we have named, they gave him the precious stones. The Emperor took them, asking nothing
of their worth. He ordered them to be taken charge of, and praised their exceeding
beauty. The ambassadors asked their questions, and beheld the court and its customs.
</p>
<p>Then after a few days, they asked permission to return. The Emperor gave them his
answer and said: tell your master that the best thing in this world is moderation.
</p>
<p>The ambassadors went away and related to their master what they had seen and heard,
praising mightily the Emperor’s court with its fine customs and the manners of its
knights.
</p>
<p>Prester John, hearing the account of his ambassadors, praised the Emperor and said
that he was very wise in speech but not in deed, since he had not asked the value
of the precious stones. He sent back his ambassadors with the offer that if it should
please the Emperor they should become <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span><span class="corr" id="xd31e1645" title="Source: senechals">seneschals</span><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1647src" href="#xd31e1647">2</a> of his court. And he made them count his riches and the number and quality of his
subjects and the manners of his country.
</p>
<p>After some time, Prester John, thinking that the gems he had given the Emperor had
lost their value, since the Emperor was ignorant of their worth, called a favourite
lapidary of his and sent him in secret to the Emperor’s court; saying to him: seek
you in every way to bring me back those stones, whatever it may cost.
</p>
<p>The lapidary set out, bearing with him many stones of rare beauty, and began to show
them at the court. The barons and the knights came to admire his arts. And the man
proved himself very clever. When he saw that one of his visitors had an office at
the court, he did not sell, but gave away, and so many rings did he give away that
his fame reached the Emperor. The latter sent for him, and showed him his own stones.
The lapidary praised them, but temperately. He asked the Emperor if he possessed still
more precious stones. Then the Emperor brought forth the three fine gems which the
lapidary was <span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span>anxious to see. Then the lapidary grew exultant, and taking one of the stones, held
it in his hand and said: this gem, Sire, is worth the finest city in your land. Then
he took up another and said: this gem, Sire, is worth the finest of your provinces.
Then he took up the third gem and said: Sire, this stone is worth more than all your
empire. He closed his hand on the gems, and the virtue in one of them rendered him
invisible,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1655src" href="#xd31e1655">3</a> so that none could see him, and down the steps of the palace he went, and returned
to his lord, Prester John, and presented him with the stones with great joy.

<h2 class="label">III</h2>
<h2 class="main">Of a wise Greek whom a King kept in prison, and how he judged of a courser</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the parts of Greece there was a nobleman who wore a king’s crown and had a mighty
realm. His name was Philip, and he held in prison a <span class="pageNum" id="pb41">[<a href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>learned Greek for some misdeed of the latter. So learned was this Greek that his intellect
saw beyond the stars.
</p>
<p>It happened one day that the king received from Spain the gift of a noble courser
of great strength and perfect form. And the king called for his shoeing-smith that
he might learn of the worth of the steed, and it was answered him that the wisest
counsellor in all things lay in his majesty’s prison.
</p>
<p>The horse was ordered to be brought to the exercising ground, while the Greek was
set free from the prison. Look over this horse for me, said the king, for I have heard
that you are instructed in many things. The Greek examined the courser and said: Sire,
the horse is indeed a fine one, but I must tell you that it has been reared on asses’
milk. The king sent into Spain to learn how the horse had been reared, and heard that
its dam having died, the foal had been reared on asses’ milk. This caused the king
great surprise, and he ordered that half a loaf of bread should be given to the Greek
every day at the expense of the court.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then it happened one day that the king gathered all his precious gems together, and
calling the Greek out of prison, said to him: master, you are a wise fellow and understand
all things. Tell me, if you know aught of precious stones, which is the rarest of
all these?
</p>
<p>The Greek looked and said: which, Sire, is dearest to you? The king took up a stone,
beautiful above the others, and said: master, this seems to me the loveliest and of
the greatest value.
</p>
<p>The Greek took it up and laid it in his hand and closed his fingers on it, and laid
it to his ear and said: Sire, there is a worm here. The king sent for his master jeweller
and had the stone broken open, and found a live worm in it. Then he praised the marvellous
science of the Greek, and ordered that a whole loaf of bread be given him each day
at the expense of the court.
</p>
<p>Then after many days, the king bethought himself that he was not the legitimate king.
He sent for the Greek, and took him into a secret place and began to speak and said:
I believe you are a master of great learning, as I have clearly seen you prove yourself
in matters whereof I <span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>have questioned you. I want you to tell me now whose son I am.
</p>
<p>The Greek replied: you know well, Sire, you are the son of such a father. And the
king said: do not answer me as you think merely to please me. Answer me truly, for
if you do not I will send you to an evil death. Then the Greek spoke and said: Sire,
I tell you you are the son of a baker. Then the king cried: I will learn this of my
mother, and he sent for her, and with ferocious threats constrained her to speak.
His mother confessed the truth.
</p>
<p>Then the king closeted himself in a room with the Greek and said: my master, I have
seen great proof of your wisdom. Tell me, I beg of you, how you knew these things.
Then the Greek made answer. Sire, I will tell you. I knew that the courser was raised
on asses’ milk from common mother wit, since I saw that its ears drooped, which is
not the nature of horses. I knew of the worm in the stone, for stones are naturally
cold, and this one was warm. Warm it could not be naturally, were it not for some
animal possessing life. And how did you know I was a baker’s son, asked the king.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Greek made answer: Sire, when I told you about the courser which was a marvellous
thing, you ordered me the gift of half a loaf of bread a day, and when I spoke to
you of the stone you gave me a whole loaf. Then it was I perceived whose son you were,
for had you been the son of a king, it would have seemed a slight matter to you to
give me a noble city, whereas it seemed a great thing to you to recompense me with

<h2 class="main">How a jongleur lamented before Alexander the conduct of a knight, to whom he had made
a gift on condition that the knight should give him whatsoever Alexander might present
him with<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1689src" href="#xd31e1689">1</a></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When Alexander was before the city of Gaza, with a vast besieging train, a noble knight
escaped <span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>from prison. And being poorly provided in raiment and accoutrement, he set forth to
see Alexander who lavished his gifts more prodigally than other lords.
</p>
<p>As the knight walked along his way, he fell in with a gentleman of the court<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1699src" href="#xd31e1699">2</a> who asked him whither he was going. The knight replied: I am going to Alexander to
request some gifts from him, so that I may return with honour to my country. Then
the man of the court said, what is it that you want, for I will give it to you, provided
that you give me what Alexander may present you with. The knight made answer: give
me a horse to ride and a beast of burden and such things and money as will suffice
for me to make return to my own country. The jongleur gave him these, and they went
on in company together to Alexander, who having fought a desperate action before the
city of Gaza, had left the battlefield and was being relieved of his armour in a tent.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span></p>
<p>The knight and the jongleur came forward. The knight made his request to Alexander
humbly and graciously. Alexander made no sign, nor did he give any reply. The knight
left the man of the court and set out on the road to return to his own country.
</p>
<p>He had not gone very far, however, when the citizens of Gaza brought the keys of the
city to Alexander, submitting themselves entirely to him as their lord.
</p>
<p>Alexander then turned to his barons and said: where is he who asked a gift of me?
Then they sent for the knight who had asked the king for a gift. The knight came before
the king, who said to him: take, noble knight, the keys of the city of Gaza which
most willingly I give you. The knight replied: Sire, do not give me a city. I beg
you rather to give me gold or silver or other things as it may please you.
</p>
<p>Then Alexander smiled, and ordered that the knight should be given two thousand silver
marks.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1709src" href="#xd31e1709">3</a> And this was set down for the smallest gift which Alexander ever made. The knight
took the marks <span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>and handed them to the jongleur. The latter came before Alexander, and with great
insistence asked that he should be heard, and so much he argued that he had the knight
arrested.
</p>
<p>And he shaped his argument before Alexander in this wise: Sire, I found this man on
the road and asked him whither he was going and why, and he told me he was going to
Alexander to ask a gift. I made a pact with him, giving him what he desired on condition
that he should give me whatsoever Alexander should make him a present of. Therefore
he has broken the pact, for he refused the noble city of Gaza, and took the marks.
Therefore, before your excellency, I ask that you heed my request and order him to
make up the difference between the value of the city and the marks.
</p>
<p>The knight spoke, and first of all he confessed that the pact had been so, and then
he said: just Sire, he who asks me this is a jongleur, and a jongleur’s heart may
not aspire to the lordship of a city. He was thinking of silver and of gold, and such
was his desire. I have fully satisfied his intention. Therefore, I beg your lordship
<span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>to see to my deliverance as may please your wise counsel.
</p>
<p>Alexander and his barons set free the knight, and complimented him on his wisdom.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1721src" href="#xd31e1721">4</a>

<h2 class="main">How a king committed a reply to a young son of his who had to bear it to the ambassadors
of Greece<span id="xd31e1729"></span></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was a king in the parts of Egypt who had a first-born son who would wear the
crown after him. The father began from the son’s very earliest years to give him instruction
at the hands of wise men of mature age, and never had it happened to the boy to know
the games and follies of childhood.
</p>
<p>It chanced one day that his father committed to him an answer for the ambassadors
of Greece.
</p>
<p>The youth stood in the place of discourse to make answer to the ambassadors, and the
weather <span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>was unsettled and rainy. The boy turned his eyes to one of the palace windows, and
perceived some lads gathering the rain water into little troughs and making mud pies.
</p>
<p>The youth, on seeing this, left the platform, and running quickly down the palace
stairs, went and joined the other lads who were gathering up the water, and took part
in the game. The barons and knights followed him quickly, and brought him back to
the palace. They closed the window, and the youth gave an answer such as was satisfactory
to the ambassadors.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1738src" href="#xd31e1738">1</a>
</p>
<p>After the council, the people went away. The father summoned philosophers and men
of learning, and laid the point before them.
</p>
<p>Some of the sages reputed it to be a matter of the lad’s nature; others suggested
it portended a weakness of spirit; some went so far as to hint it betokened an infirmity
of the mind.
</p>
<p>Thus one gave one opinion, and another another, according to their art and science.
</p>
<p>But one philosopher said: tell me how the youth has been brought up. And they told
him <span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>the lad had been brought up with sages and men of ripe age, with nothing of childishness
in them.
</p>
<p>Then the wise man answered: do not marvel if nature <span class="corr" id="xd31e1750" title="Source: ask">asks</span> for what she has lost, for it is right for childhood to play, as it is right for
age to reflect.

<h2 class="main">How it came into the mind of King David to learn the number of his subjects</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">King David, being king by the grace of God, who had raised him from a shepherd to
be a noble, wished one day to learn at all hazards the number of his subjects: which
was an act of vain-glory most displeasing to the Lord, who sent an angel who spoke
thus: David, you have sinned. So your Lord sends me to tell you. Will you remain three
years in hell<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1759src" href="#xd31e1759">1</a> or three months in the hands of His enemies which are yours, or will you leave yourself
to the judgment of your Lord?
</p>
<p>David answered: I put myself in the hands of my Lord. Let Him do with me what He will.
Now what did God do? He punished him <span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>according to his sin, taking away by death the greater part of his people in whose
great number he had <span class="corr" id="xd31e1768" title="Source: vaingloried">vain-gloried</span>. And thus he reduced and belittled their number.
</p>
<p>One day it came to pass that while David was riding he saw the angel of the Lord going
about slaying with the naked sword, and just as the angel was about to strike a man,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1773src" href="#xd31e1773">2</a> David got off his horse and said: Highness, praise be to God, do not kill the innocent,
but kill me; for the fault is all mine. Then for this good word, God pardoned the
people and stayed the slaughter.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1776src" href="#xd31e1776">3</a>

<h2 class="label">VII</h2>
<h2 class="main">Here it is told how the angel spoke to Solomon, and said that the Lord God would take
away the kingdom from his son for his sins<span id="xd31e1786"></span></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We read of Solomon that he made another offence to God, for which he was condemned
to the loss of his kingdom. The angel spoke to him <span class="pageNum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>and said: Solomon, on account of your sins, it is meet that you should lose your realm.
But our Lord sends to tell you that for the good merits of your father, He will not
take it away from you in your life, but for your wrong-doing He will take it away
from your son. Whereby we see the father’s merits enjoyed by the son, and a father’s
sins punished in his child.
</p>
<p>Be it known that Solomon laboured studiously on this earth, and with his learning
and talent had a great and noble reign.
</p>
<p>And he took provision that foreign heirs should not succeed him, that is, heirs such
as were outside his lineage.
</p>
<p>So he took many wives and many concubines that he might have many heirs, but God who
is the supreme dispenser willed it that by all his wives and concubines, who were
many, he had but one son.
</p>
<p>Then Solomon made provision so as to dispose and order his kingdom under this son
of his, whose name was Roboam, that for certain he should reign after him.
</p>
<p>So from his youth upwards he ordered his <span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>son’s life with many precepts and schoolings. And more he did, so that a great treasure
should be amassed and laid in a safe place.
</p>
<p>And further he took urgent care that there was concord and peace with all the lords
whose lands were near to his own, and his own vassals he held in peace and without
contentions. And further he taught his son the courses of the stars and how to have
mastery over demons.
</p>
<p>And all these things he did that Roboam should reign after him.
</p>
<p>When Solomon was dead, Roboam took counsel of wise old men, and asked their advice
as to how he should manage his people.
</p>
<p>The old men counselled him: call your people together and with sweet words say you
love them as yourself, that they are as your crown, that if your father was harsh
to them, you will be gentle and benign, and whereas he oppressed them, you will let
them live in ease and content. If they were oppressed in the making of the temple,
you will assist them.
</p>
<p>Such was the advice the wise old men of the kingdom gave him.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span></p>
<p>Roboam went away, and called together a counsel of young men, and asked them similarly
their advice. And these asked him: how did they from whom you first sought advice
counsel you? And he told them word for word.
</p>
<p>Then the young men said: they deceive you, since kingdoms are not held by words but
by prowess and courage. Whence, if you speak soft words to the people, it will seem
to them you are afraid of them, and so they will cast you down, and will not take
you for their lord nor obey you. Listen to our counsel who are all your servants,
and a master may do with his servants as he will. Tell the people with vigour and
courage that they are your servants, and that whosoever disobeys you, you will punish
according to your harsh law. If Solomon oppressed them for the building of the temple,
you too will oppress them if it shall please you. Thus the people will not hold you
for a child, but all will fear you, and so you will keep your kingdom and your crown.
</p>
<p>Foolish Roboam followed the young men’s advice. He called together his people, and
spoke <span class="pageNum" id="pb55">[<a href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>harsh words to them. The people grew angry, and the chiefs became disturbed. They
made secret pacts and leagues. Certain barons<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1813src" href="#xd31e1813">1</a> plotted together, so that in thirty-four days after the death of Solomon, his son
lost ten of the twelve parts of his kingdom through the foolish counsel of the young
men.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1816src" href="#xd31e1816">2</a>

<h2 class="main">Of the gift of a king’s son to a king of Syria who had been driven from his throne</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A lord of Greece who possessed a mighty kingdom and whose name was Aulix had a young
son whom he had taught the seven liberal arts.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1825src" href="#xd31e1825">1</a> And he instructed him in the moral life, that is the life of fine manners.
</p>
<p>One day this king took much gold and gave it to his son and said: spend it as you
like. And he <span class="pageNum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>told his barons not to instruct him how to spend it, but only to observe his behaviour
and his habits.
</p>
<p>The barons, following the young man, were with him one day at the palace windows.
</p>
<p>The youth was pensive. He saw passing along the road folk who from their dress and
person seemed very noble. The road ran at the foot of the palace.
</p>
<p>The young man ordered that all these folk should be brought before him. His will was
obeyed in this, and all the passers-by came before him.
</p>
<p>And one of them who was bolder in heart and more cheerful in look than the others,
came forward and asked: Sire, what do you want of me? I would know whence you come,
and what is your state.
</p>
<p>And the man replied: Sire, I come from Italy, and a rich merchant I am, and my wealth
which I have gained I did not have as patrimony, but I earned it with my labour.
</p>
<p>The king’s son asked the next man whose features were noble and who stood with timid
face further off than the other, and did not dare advance so boldly.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>And this man said: what do you ask of me, Sire? The youth replied: I ask you whence
you come, and what is your state.
</p>
<p>The man answered: I am from Syria and am a king, and I have acted so that my subjects
have driven me out of my kingdom.
</p>
<p>Then the youth took all the gold and silver and gave it to him who had been driven
out.
</p>
<p>The news spread through the palace.
</p>
<p>The barons and the knights met in conclave, and at the court nothing else was spoken
of but this gift of the gold.
</p>
<p>All was related to the father, questions and answers, word for word. The king began
to speak to his son, many barons being present, and said: how did you come to distribute
the money in this manner? What idea was it that moved you? What reason can you offer
us for not giving to him who had enriched himself through his ability, while to him
who had lost through his own fault you gave all? The wise young man made answer: Sire,
I gave nothing to him who taught me nothing, nor indeed did I make a gift to anyone,
for what I gave was a recompense, <span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>not a present. The merchant taught me nothing, and nothing was due to him. But he
who was of my own state, son of a king who wore a king’s crown, and out of his folly
did so act that his subjects drove him away, taught me so much that my subjects will
not drive me out. Therefore, I made a small recompense to him who taught me so much.
</p>
<p>On hearing the judgment of the youth, the father and his barons praised his great
wisdom, saying that his youth gave good promise for the years when he should be ripe
to deal with matters of state.
</p>
<p>Tidings of the happenings were spread far and wide among lords and barons, and the
wise men made great disputations about it.

<h2 class="label">IX</h2>
<h2 class="main">Here it is treated of an argument and a judgment that took place in Alexandria</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Alexandria, which is in the parts of Roumania—for there are twelve Alexandrias
which <span class="pageNum" id="pb59">[<a href="#pb59">59</a>]</span>Alexander founded in the March before he died<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1860src" href="#xd31e1860">1</a>—in this Alexandria there are streets where the Saracens live, who make foods for
sale, and the people seek out the street where the finest and most delicate foodstuffs
are to be found, just as among us one goes in search of cloths.
</p>
<p>On a certain Monday, a Saracen cook whose name was Fabrae was standing by his kitchen
door, when a poor Saracen entered the kitchen with a loaf in his hand. Money to purchase
viands he had none, so he held his loaf over the pot, and let the savoury steam soak
into it, and ate it.
</p>
<p>The Saracen Fabrae, who was doing a poor trade that morning, was annoyed at the action,
and seized the poor Saracen, and said to him: pay me for what you have taken of mine.
</p>
<p>The poor man answered: I have taken nothing from your kitchen save steam.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1867src" href="#xd31e1867">2</a> Pay me for what you have taken of mine, Fabrae continued to exclaim.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span></p>
<p>The dispute over this new and difficult question which had never arisen before, continued
to such an extent that news of it reached the Sultan.
</p>
<p>Owing to the great novelty of the argument, the Sultan called together a number of
wise men. He laid the question before them.
</p>
<p>The Saracen wise men began to dispute, and there were those who held that the steam
did not belong to the cook, for which they adduced many good reasons. Steam cannot
be appropriated, for it dissolves in the air, and has no useful substance or property.
Therefore the poor man ought not to pay. Others argued that the steam was still part
of the viand cooking, in fact that it belonged to it and emanated from its property,
that a man sells the products of his trade, and that it is the custom for him who
takes thereof to pay.
</p>
<p>Many were the opinions given, and finally came the judgment: since this man sells
his foodstuffs and you and others buy them, you must pay his viands according to their
value. If for the food he sells and of which he gives the useful <span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>properties he is accustomed to take useful money, then since he has sold steam which
is the vaporous part of his cooking, you, sir, must ring a piece of money, and it
shall be understood that payment is satisfied by the sound that comes therefrom.
</p>
<p>And the Sultan ordered that this judgment be observed.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1880src" href="#xd31e1880">3</a>

<p class="first">A townsman of Bari went on a pilgrimage, and left three hundred byzantines<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1895src" href="#xd31e1895">1</a> to a friend on these conditions: I shall make my journey as God wills, and should

<span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>within a certain time, you shall return me the money, keeping back what you will.
The pilgrim went on his pilgrimage, came back at the established time and demanded
his byzantines back.
</p>
<p>His friend said: tell me over the pact again. The wanderer told it over again. You
say well, quoth the friend: ten byzantines I give back to you, and two hundred and
ninety I keep for myself.
</p>
<p>The pilgrim began to get angry. What kind of faith is this? You take away from me
wrongfully what is mine.
</p>
<p>The friend replied calmly: I do you no wrong, but if you think I do, let us go before
the governors of the city. A law-suit ensued.
</p>
<p>The Slave of Bari was the judge,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1905src" href="#xd31e1905">2</a> and heard both sides. He formulated the argument, and to him who held the money he
said: give back the two hundred and ninety byzantines to the pilgrim, and the pilgrim
must give you back the ten you <span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>handed him. For the pact was so; what you want you will give to me. Therefore the
two hundred and ninety which you want, give them to him, and the ten you do not want,
take them.

<p>This Beltram boasted that he had more sense than anyone else. Whence many judgments
came into being, some of which are written here.
</p>
<p>Beltram plotted with the Young King that he should persuade his father to give him
his share of inheritance. And so insistent was the son that he gained his request.
And he gave all away to gentlefolk and to poor knights, so that nothing remained to
him and he had no more to give away.
</p>
<p>A court player asked him for a gift. He replied that he had given all away, but this
only is left me,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2091src" href="#xd31e2091">4</a> a bad tooth, and my father has promised two thousand marks to whomsoever shall prevail

marks <span class="pageNum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>beneath it, together with a bundle of cloth so that the whole should seem larger.
</p>
<p>And the Young King going through the room, the treasurer showed him the pile saying:
Sire, see how you dispense your gifts. You see what a large sum is two hundred marks,
which seem nothing to you.

<p>And the Young King looked and said: that seems little enough to me to give to so valiant

<h2 class="main">Of the great liberality and courtesy of the King of England</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The young King of England squandered and gave away all his possessions.
</p>
<p>Once a poor knight beheld the cover of a silver dish, and said to himself: if I could
but hide that upon me, my household could thrive thereon <span class="pageNum" id="pb73">[<a href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>for many a day. He hid the cover on his person. The seneschal, when the dinner was
ended, examined the silver, and found that the dish was missing. So they began to
spread the news and to search the knights at the door.
</p>
<p>The young King had observed him who had taken it, and came to him silently, and said
to him very softly: give it to me, for I shall not be searched. And the knight all
shamefaced, obeyed his behest.
</p>
<p>Outside the door, the young King gave it back to him and hid it on him, and then he
sent for him, and gave him the other half of the dish.
</p>
<p>And his courtesy even went further; for one night some impoverished gentlemen entered
his room in the belief that he was asleep. They collected his arms and clothes in
order to steal them. One of them was reluctant to leave behind a rich counterpane
which was covering the King, and he seized it and began to pull. The King, for fear
he should remain uncovered, took hold of the end of it and held it fast, while the
other tugged, and the knights present, in order to save time, lent him a hand.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span></p>
<p>And then the king spoke: this is not theft but robbery—to wit, taking by force. The
knights fled when they heard him speak, for they had believed him to be sleeping.
</p>
<p>One day, the old King, the father of this young King, took him harshly to task, saying,
where is your treasure?
</p>
<p>And he answered: Sire, I have more than you have. There was much discussion. Both
sides bound themselves to a wager.
</p>
<p>The day was fixed when each was to show his treasure.
</p>
<p>The young King invited all the barons of the country who were in the neighbourhood.
His father set up that day a sumptuous pavilion and sent for gold and silver in dishes
and plates and much armour and a great quantity of precious stones, and laid all on
his carpets and said to his son: where is your treasure? Thereupon the son drew his
sword from its scabbard.
</p>
<p>The assembled knights crowded in from the streets and the squares. The entire city
seemed to be full of knights.
</p>
<p>The King was unable to defend himself <span class="pageNum" id="pb75">[<a href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>against them. The gold remained in the power of the young King, who said to his knights:
take your treasure. Some took gold, some plate, some one thing and some another, so
that in a little while everything was distributed. The father gathered all his forces
to take the treasure.
</p>
<p>The son shut himself up in a castle, and Bertrand de Born was with him. The father
came to besiege him.
</p>
<p>One day through being oversure, he was struck in the head by an arrow (for he was
pursued by misfortune) and killed.
</p>
<p>But before his death he was visited by all his creditors, and they asked him for the
treasure which they had lent him. Whereat the young King answered: sirs, you come
at a bad season, for my treasure has been distributed. My possessions are all given
away. My body is infirm, and it would be a poor pledge for you.
</p>
<p>But he sent for a notary, and when the notary had come, that courteous king said to
him: write that I bind my soul to perpetual bondage until such time as my creditors
are paid. Then he died. After his death they went to his father <span class="pageNum" id="pb76">[<a href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>and asked for the money. The father answered them roughly, saying: you are the men
who lent to my son wherefore he waged war upon me, and therefore under the penalty
of your life and goods take yourselves out of my dominions.
</p>
<p>Then one of them spoke and said: Sire, we shall not be the losers, for we have his
soul in our keeping.
</p>
<p>And the king asked in what way, and they showed him the document.
</p>
<p>Then the king humbled himself and said: God forfend that the soul of so valiant a
man should be in bondage for money, and he ordered them to be paid, and so it befell.
</p>
<p>Then Bertran de Born came into his hands, and he asked for him and said: you declared
you had more sense than any man in the world; now where is your sense? Bertran replied:
Sire, I have lost it. And when did you lose it? I lost it when your son died.
</p>
<p>Then the King knew that he had lost his wit for love of his son<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2149src" href="#xd31e2149">1</a>, so he pardoned him and loaded him with rich gifts.

<h2 class="main">How three necromancers came to the court of the Emperor Frederick</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Emperor Frederick was a most noble sovereign, and men who had talent flocked to
him from all sides because he was liberal in his gifts, and looked with pleasure on
those who had any special talent.
</p>
<p>To him came musicians, troubadours, and pleasant story-tellers, men of art<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2162src" href="#xd31e2162">1</a>, jousters, fencers and folk of every kind.
</p>
<p>One day the table was set and the Emperor was washing his hands,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2169src" href="#xd31e2169">2</a> when there came to him three necromancers garbed in long pilgrims’ robes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2172src" href="#xd31e2172">3</a> They greeted him forthwith, and he asked: which of you is the master? One of them
came forward and said: Sire, I am he. And the Emperor besought him that he would have
the <span class="pageNum" id="pb78">[<a href="#pb78">78</a>]</span>courtesy to show his art. So they cast their spells and practised their arts.
</p>
<p>The weather began to grow stormy, and a sudden shower of rain with thunder and lightning
and thunder-bolts, and it seemed that a hail fell like balls of steel. The knights
fled through the halls, one going in one direction, one in another.
</p>
<p>The weather cleared up again. The necromancers<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2183src" href="#xd31e2183">4</a> took their leave and asked for a recompense.
</p>
<p>The Emperor said: ask me then. And they made their request. The Count of San Bonifazio
was then near the Emperor. So they said: Sire, bid this lord come and succour us against
our enemies.
</p>
<p>The Emperor laid this command upon him with affectionate insistence. The Count set
out on his way with the masters.
</p>
<p>They took him to a noble city, showed him knights of high lineage, and prepared for
him a handsome horse and fine arms, and said: these are at your command.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb79">[<a href="#pb79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p>The enemy came up for battle. The Count defeated them, and delivered the city. He
won back the country. They gave him a wife. He had children.
</p>
<p>After some time, he ruled the land.
</p>
<p>The necromancers left him alone for a very long period.
</p>
<p>Then they returned. The Count’s son was already full forty years old. The Count was
old. The necromancers came back and said that they wished to go and see the Emperor
and the court. The Count answered: the Empire will by this time more than once have
changed hands; the people will all be new: where should I return? The necromancers
answered: no matter<span class="corr" id="xd31e2197" title="Not in source">,</span> we will take you with us all the same.
</p>
<p>They set forth; they walked for a long time; they reached the court.
</p>
<p>They found the Emperor among his barons, still pouring water over his hands as he
had been doing when the Count went away with the necromancers.
</p>
<p>The Emperor made him tell his tale, and he told it. I have taken a wife. My children
are <span class="pageNum" id="pb80">[<a href="#pb80">80</a>]</span>forty years old. Three pitched battles have I fought. The world is all topsy-turvy.
How comes this?
</p>
<p>The Emperor made him relate all this with great mirth for the barons and knights.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2207src" href="#xd31e2207">5</a>

<h2 class="main">How the Emperor Frederick’s goshawk escaped to Milan</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">While the Emperor Frederick was besieging Milan, one of his goshawks escaped and flew
into Milan. He sent ambassadors to claim it.
</p>
<p>The councillors called a meeting. There were very many speeches. All agreed that it
would be greater courtesy to send it back than to keep it.
</p>
<p>A very old citizen of Milan advised the authorities and spoke thus: we hold the goshawk
as if it were the Emperor, so we shall make him repent of what he has done to the
dominions of <span class="pageNum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>Milan. Therefore I urge that it should not be returned to him.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2224src" href="#xd31e2224">1</a>
</p>
<p>The ambassadors went back and told how the council had gone.
</p>
<p>When the Emperor heard this, he said: how came that to pass? Was there anyone in Milan
to contradict the proposal of the council? And the ambassadors said: yes Sire, there
was. And what manner of man was he? Sire, he was an old man.
</p>
<p>It cannot be, replied the Emperor<span class="corr" id="xd31e2231" title="Not in source">,</span> that an old man could make so vile a speech. None the less, Sire, so it was. Tell
me, said the Emperor, what manner of man he was and how garbed. Sire, his hair was
white, and his coat was striped.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2233src" href="#xd31e2233">2</a>
</p>
<p>It may well be, said the Emperor, that since his coat was striped he was a madman.

and how he took away his drinking-cup</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once when the Emperor Frederick went hunting, dressed, as was his wont, in plain green,
he came upon a countryman at a fountain who had spread a gleaming white cloth on the
green grass, and had a cup made of tamerisk<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2245src" href="#xd31e2245">1</a> and a nice clean loaf of bread.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2250src" href="#xd31e2250">2</a>
</p>
<p>The Emperor came up and asked leave to drink. The countryman replied: with what should
I give you to drink? You shall not set your lips to this cup. If you have a drinking
horn, I will gladly give you some wine.
</p>
<p>The Emperor answered: lend me your cup, and I will drink so that it does not touch
my mouth. And the countryman handed it to him, and he kept to his promise. He did
not give it <span class="pageNum" id="pb83">[<a href="#pb83">83</a>]</span>back though, but on the contrary, spurred his horse and ran off with the cup.
</p>
<p>The countryman was confident that the man was one of the Emperor’s knights.
</p>
<p>The following day he went to the court. The Emperor told his servants if such and
such a countryman come, let him in, and do not close the door to him. The countryman
came. He appeared before the Emperor. He complained of the loss of his cup. The Emperor
made him tell his story many times to his great amusement.
</p>
<p>The barons listened to it with glee. And the Emperor said: would you recognise your
cup? Yes, Sire. Then the Emperor drew forth the cup to show that it had been he in
person.
</p>
<p>Then the Emperor, because of the man’s cleanliness, gave him rich gifts.

<p class="first">The Emperor Frederick had two exceedingly <span class="pageNum" id="pb84">[<a href="#pb84">84</a>]</span>wise men about him; one was called Bolgaro<span class="corr" id="xd31e2274" title="Not in source">,</span> the other Martino.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2276src" href="#xd31e2276">1</a>
</p>
<p>One day the Emperor was in the company of these two wise men, one of them on his right
hand, and the other on his left.
</p>
<p>And the Emperor put a question to them and said: can I give to any one of my subjects
and take away from another, according to my will and without other cause? Since I
am their lord, and the law says that what pleases the lord shall be law to his subjects.
Say then whether I may do this, since such is my pleasure.
</p>
<p>One of the two wise men replied: Sire, whatever is your pleasure, that you may do
to your subjects without causing wrong.
</p>
<p>The other sage answered and said: to me it seems not, since the law is utterly just,
and its conditions must be observed and followed with an extreme nicety. When you
take away, it should be known from whom and also to whom you give.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb85">[<a href="#pb85">85</a>]</span></p>
<p>Since both of the wise men spoke the truth, he offered gifts to both. To the one he
gave a scarlet hat and a white palfrey; and to the other he gave the right to make
a law to please his fancy.
</p>
<p>Whence there arose a great discussion among the learned as to which of the two he
had given the richer present.
</p>
<p>It was held that to him who had said he could give and take away as it pleased him
he had given clothing and a palfrey as to a minstrel because he had flattered him.
To him who followed justice, he gave the right to make a law.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Saladin<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2296src" href="#xd31e2296">1</a> was a most noble lord, brave and generous. Once he gave two hundred marks to a man
who had given him a basket of winter roses <span class="pageNum" id="pb86">[<a href="#pb86">86</a>]</span>grown in a hot-house. His treasurer wrote down the sum in his presence, and through
a slip of the pen he wrote three hundred marks. Saladin said: what are you doing?
The treasurer answered: Sire, I have blundered, and he was about to cancel the surplus.
Then Saladin spoke: do not cancel it; write four hundred instead. It would be ill
for me were your pen more generous than I.
</p>
<p>This Saladin, at the time of his sultanate, ordered a truce between himself and the
Christians, and said he would like to behold our customs, and if they pleased him,
he would become a Christian.
</p>
<p>The truce was made.
</p>
<p>Saladin came in person to study the habits of the Christians; he beheld the tables
set for eating with dazzlingly white cloths, and he praised them exceedingly.
</p>
<p>And he beheld the disposition of the table where the King of France ate, set apart
from the others.
</p>
<p>And he praised it highly. He saw the places where the great ones of the realm ate,
and he praised them highly.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb87">[<a href="#pb87">87</a>]</span></p>
<p>He saw how the poor ate on the ground in humility, and this he disapproved greatly.
</p>
<p>Moreover, he blamed them for that the lord’s friends ate more lowly and further down
the table.
</p>
<p>Then the Christians went to see the customs of the Saracens, and saw that they ate
on the ground grossly.
</p>
<p>The Sultan had his pavilion, where they ate, richly draped and the ground covered
with carpets which were closely worked with crosses.
</p>
<p>The stupid Christians entered, stepping with their feet on these crosses and spitting
upon them as on the ground.
</p>
<p>Then the Sultan spoke and took them to task harshly: do you preach the Cross and scorn
it thus? It would seem then that you love your God only with show of words and not
with deeds. Your behaviour and your manners do not meet with my liking.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A burgher of France had a wife who was extremely fair.
</p>
<p>Once she was at a festival with other women of the city. And there was present a very
beautiful woman who was much looked at by all. The burgher’s wife said to herself:
if I had so fine a tunic as she has, I should be no less looked at than she is.
</p>
<p>She returned home to her husband and showed him a cross face.
</p>
<p>Her husband asked her frequently why she was so aggrieved. And the woman replied:
because I am not dressed so that I can be with other women. For at such and such a
feast, the other women who were not so fair as I am were looked at, but I was not
for my ugly tunic.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2334src" href="#xd31e2334">1</a>
</p>
<p>Then her husband promised her that with his first earnings he would buy her a fine
tunic.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb89">[<a href="#pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p>But a few days passed when a burgher came to him and asked for the loan of ten marks.
And he offered him a gain of two marks at a certain date. The husband replied: I will
have none of it, for my soul would be in danger of hell fire. And the wife said: Oh,
you disloyal traitor, you will not do it so that you need not buy me my tunic.
</p>
<p>Then the burgher, through the urgings of his wife, lent the money for an interest
of two marks, and bought his wife the tunic. The wife went to mass with the other
women.
</p>
<p>At that time there lived Merlin.
</p>
<p>And one man spoke and said: by Saint John, that is a most fair lady.
</p>
<p>And Merlin, the wise prophet, spoke and said: truly she is fair, if only the enemies
of God did not share that tunic with her.
</p>
<p>And the lady turned and said: tell me in what way the enemies of God have a share
in my tunic.
</p>
<p>He answered: lady, I will tell you. Do you remember when you went to a certain feast,
where the other women were more regarded than you because of your ugly tunic? And
you returned <span class="pageNum" id="pb90">[<a href="#pb90">90</a>]</span>and showed yourself cross to your husband? And he promised to buy you a tunic with
his first earnings? And a few days afterwards, a burgher came to borrow ten marks,
at a usury of two, whereon you urged your husband to do this? So from this ungodly
gain does your tunic come. Tell me, lady, if I have erred in aught.
</p>
<p>Certainly, sir, in naught have you erred, answered the lady. And God forbid that such
an ungodly tunic should remain upon me.
</p>
<p>And before the whole crowd she doffed it, and begged Merlin to take it and deliver
her from such grievous peril.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It was the custom in the kingdom of France that a man who deserved to be dishonoured
and condemned should go in a cart.
</p>
<p>And if it happened that he was condemned to death, never was found anyone willing
to converse with him or stay with him for any reason.
</p>
<p>Lancelot<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2381src" href="#xd31e2381">1</a> when he became mad for love of Queen Guinevre went in the cart, and was driven to
many places.

<p>And from that day on the cart was no more <span class="pageNum" id="pb92">[<a href="#pb92">92</a>]</span>despised, and ladies and knights of fine birth go in it now for their disport.
</p>
<p>Alas! errant world and ignorant and discourteous people, how much greater was Our
Lord who made the heaven and earth, than Lancelot who was made a knight<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2390src" href="#xd31e2390">2</a> and changed and upset so great a usance in the kingdom of France, which was not his
kingdom.
</p>
<p>And Jesus Christ, Our Lord, pardoning His own enemies could not make men pardon theirs.
</p>
<p>And this He did and willed in His kingdom to those who crucified Him.
</p>
<p>He pardoned them, and prayed to His Father for them.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A knight of Lombardy, whose name was G—— was a close friend of the Emperor Frederick,
and had no sons to whom to leave his estate, although indeed he had heirs of his own
kin. So he formed the resolve to spend all he possessed during his life-time, that
nothing should be left after him.
</p>
<p>He reckoned the number of years he might live, and added another ten. But he did not
add enough, for wasting and squandering his goods, he was surprised by old age, and
lived too long, and found himself in poverty, for he had squandered his all.
</p>
<p>He took counsel for his sad state, and remembered the Emperor Frederick, who had shown
<span class="pageNum" id="pb95">[<a href="#pb95">95</a>]</span>him much friendship, and who had always spent much and given away much at his court.
</p>
<p>He resolved to go to him, believing that he would be received with great affection<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2455src" href="#xd31e2455">1</a>.
</p>
<p>So he went to the Emperor, and stood before him. He (the Emperor) asked who he was,
although he knew him well. The knight told his name. He asked about his conditions.
The knight told what had happened to him, and how he had been outwitted by time.
</p>
<p>The Emperor replied: leave my court, and do not under penalty of your life, come into
my territory again, for you are he who did not want that others should inherit aught
after your death.

fisherman with a boat, but of so small a size that there was only room for the countryman
and one sheep at a time. Then the countryman began to cross over with one sheep, and
he began to row: the river was wide. He rowed and passed over.

a man of great courage and prowess.
</p>
<p>And when the Saracens came to attack Spain, he was in that battle called the Spagnata,
the most perilous battle that there has been since that of the Greeks and the Trojans.
Then were the Saracens in great number, with many kinds of engines, and Riccar Loghercio
was the leader of the first battalion. And as the horses could not be put in the van
for fear of the engines, he bade his followers turn the hindquarters of their horses
towards the enemy; and they backed so long that they found themselves in the enemy’s
midst.
</p>
<p>And so the battle proceeded and they continued to slay right and left, so that they
utterly destroyed the enemy.
</p>
<p>And when, on another occasion, the Count of Toulouse was fighting against the Count
of <span class="pageNum" id="pb98">[<a href="#pb98">98</a>]</span>Provence, Riccar Loghercio descended from his steed, and mounted on a mule, and the

<p>And so Messer Imberal, riding one day with his company, was taking great care to avoid
these birds, for he feared to encounter an augury. He found a woman on his path, and
asked her and said: tell me, good woman, whether you have this morning found or seen

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a most cruel king<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2594src" href="#xd31e2594">1</a> who persecuted God’s people. And his power was passing great, and yet he could achieve
nothing against that people, for God loved them.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb103">[<a href="#pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p>This king spoke with Balaam the prophet, and said: tell me, Balaam, how comes this
matter with my foes? Am I indeed more powerful than they, and yet can do them no harm?
</p>
<p>And Balaam answered: Sire, because they are God’s people. But I will do in this way,
that I will go unto them and will curse them, and you shall attack them and shall
win the victory.
</p>
<p>So this Balaam mounted his ass, and went up on to a mountain.
</p>
<p>The people were almost all down in the valley; and he went up to curse them from the
mountain<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2603src" href="#xd31e2603">2</a>.
</p>
<p>Then the angel of God went before him, and did not let him pass. And he pricked his
ass, thinking it was frightened, and it spoke and said: do not beat me, for I see
here the angel of the Lord with a sword of fire in his hand, and he will not let me
pass.
</p>
<p>Then the prophet Balaam looked and beheld the angel. And the angel spoke and said:
why are you going to curse God’s people. You shall bless them straightaway, just as
you desired to curse them, unless you wish to die.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb104">[<a href="#pb104">104</a>]</span></p>
<p>The prophet went and blessed God’s people, and the king said: what do you do? This
is not cursing.
</p>
<p>And he replied: it cannot be otherwise, for the angel of the Lord so bade me. Therefore,
do in this way<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2613src" href="#xd31e2613">3</a>. You have beautiful women: they have a lack of them. Take a number of them and dress
them richly and set on their breasts a buckle<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2618src" href="#xd31e2618">4</a> of gold or silver for an ornament, on which let there be carved the idol which you
adore (for he adored the statue of Mars) and you will speak to them as follows: that
they do not yield unless the men promise to adore that image and figure of Mars. And
then when they have sinned, I shall be free to curse them.
</p>
<p>And so the king did.
</p>
<p>He took some fair women in that manner, and sent them into the camp.
</p>
<p>The men were desirous of them, and they <span class="pageNum" id="pb105">[<a href="#pb105">105</a>]</span>consented and adored the idols and then sinned with them.
</p>
<p>Then the prophet went and cursed God’s people, and God did not succour them.

<p>And that king gave battle, and defeated them all.
</p>
<p>Wherefore the just suffered the penalty of those who sinned. They repented and atoned
and drove away the women, and became reconciled to God and returned to their former
freedom.

<p>He went home and shut himself into a room, wondering if he had not dreamed, and soon
began to believe he had not fought at all.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the angel of God came to him, and said: how are you? Of what are you thinking?
You have not dreamed, but have fought indeed and were beaten.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb106">[<a href="#pb106">106</a>]</span></p>
<p>And the king looked upon the angel and said: how can that be? I had thrice as many
troops as he; and the angel replied: and yet it has come to pass, since you are an
enemy of God.
</p>
<p>Then the king replied: oh, is my enemy then such a friend of God that he has beaten
me for that reason?
</p>
<p>No, said the angel, for God revenges Himself upon His enemies by means of His enemies.
Go you once more with your army, and you shall defeat him even as he defeated you.
</p>
<p>Then he went and fought anew with his foe, and defeated him and captured him as the
angel had foretold.

<h2 class="main">A tale of Messer Polo Traversaro</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Messer Polo Traversaro<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2716src" href="#xd31e2716">1</a> came from Romagna, and was the greatest noble in all that land, and he ruled over
almost all of it without opposition.
</p>
<p>There were three very swaggering knights, and they held that in all Romagna there
was no man worthy to sit with them as a fourth in company.
</p>
<p>And so in their meeting-place they had a bench for three, and more could not be seated
thereon, and no one dared to seat himself there for fear of their truculence.
</p>
<p>And although Messer Polo was their superior and in other things, they were obedient
to his commands, yet in that desirable place he did not dare to sit. They admitted,
however, that he was the first lord of Romagna and the one who came nearest of all
to making a fourth in their company.
</p>
<p>What did the three knights do, seeing that <span class="pageNum" id="pb111">[<a href="#pb111">111</a>]</span>Messer Polo was pressing them hard? They walled up half the door of their palace so
that he could not enter<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2730src" href="#xd31e2730">2</a>. For the man was of a very stout build. Not being able to enter, he undressed and
went in in his shirt.
</p>
<p>When they heard him, they got into their beds, and had themselves covered up as though
they were ill.
</p>
<p>Messer Polo, who had thought to find them at table, discovered them in bed. He comforted
them, and interrogated them, and inquired as to their ailments, and perceiving everything,
took his leave and went away.
</p>
<p>The knights said: this is no joke!
</p>
<p>They went to the village of one of their number where he had a beautiful little castle
with moats and a draw-bridge.
</p>
<p>They decided to winter there. One day Messer Polo went thither with a numerous company,
and when they wanted to enter, the three knights raised the bridge. Say what they
would, they did not succeed in entering.
</p>
<p>So they went away.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb112">[<a href="#pb112">112</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the winter had passed, the knights returned to the city.
</p>
<p>Messer Polo, at their return, did not rise, and they were astonished, and one of them
said: O Messer, alack, is this the courtesy you show? When strangers come to your
city, do you show them no honour?
</p>
<p>And Messer Polo replied: pardon me, gentle sirs, if I do not rise save for the bridge
that rose for me.
</p>
<p>Then the knights made much of him.
</p>
<p>One of the knights died, and the other two sawed off the third of the bench on which
they sat, when the third was dead, because in all Romagna they could not find any
knight who was worthy to sit in his place.

</p>
<p>One day it came to pass that some knights were boasting<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2765src" href="#xd31e2765">3</a> and William boasted that there was no nobleman in Provence whom he had not knocked
from his saddle, and then he said that <i>there was no woman in Provence who deserved the honour of a tournament</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2769src" href="#xd31e2769">4</a>. And this he said in the Count’s presence. And the Count answered: does that include
me too? William replied: yes, you, my lord; I say it to you.
</p>
<p>He sent for his horse, saddled and well caparisoned, attached his spurs, and set his
feet in the stirrups, and when he was ready, he turned to the Count and said: you
sir, I neither include nor accept<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2774src" href="#xd31e2774">5</a>. And he mounted his horse and <span class="pageNum" id="pb114">[<a href="#pb114">114</a>]</span>spurred it and went off. The Count was so sore grieved that he did not return to the
court.
</p>
<p>One day some ladies were gathered together for a splendid banquet; and they sent for
William of Borganda, and the Countess was there and they said: now tell us, William,
why you have so insulted the ladies of Provence? It shall cost you dear.
</p>
<p>Each one of them had a stick hidden away.
</p>
<p>The one who acted as spokeswoman said: lo! William for your folly it behoves you to
die.
</p>
<p>And William spoke, and said, seeing that he was taken unawares in such a fashion:
I beg you, ladies, by your courtesy that you grant me one favour. The ladies answered:
ask, save that you ask not to escape.
</p>
<p>Then William spoke and said: ladies, I beg you of your courtesy that whoever among
you be the greatest hussy be the first to strike me.

seeing it in that fountain; and he thought that the image had a <span class="pageNum" id="pb118">[<a href="#pb118">118</a>]</span>life of its own, that it was in the water, and did not perceive that it was but an
image of himself. He began to love it, and to fall so deeply in love with it, that
he wished to seize it.
</p>
<p>And the water grew troubled, and the image vanished, wherefore he began to weep.
</p>
<p>And the water became clear once more, and he beheld the image weeping.
</p>
<p>Then he let himself slip into the fountain, so that he drowned.
</p>
<p>The season was spring-time.
</p>
<p>Some women came to the fountain for sport. They saw the fair Narcissus drowned. They
drew him from the fountain with great lamentation, and set him by its rim.
</p>
<p>The news of it came to the God of Love.
</p>
<p>Wherefore the God of Love made of him a most lovely and verdant almond tree, and it
was and is the first tree that bears fruit and renews the time for loving.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2872src" href="#xd31e2872">2</a>

He took her home. In two months she was about to give birth to a daughter. The <span class="pageNum" id="pb121">[<a href="#pb121">121</a>]</span>physician showed no anger. On the contrary, he comforted the woman, and showed her

<p class="first">There was once a rich man who had a very beautiful woman to wife, and this man loved
her much and was very jealous of her.
</p>
<p>Now it happened, in God’s pleasure, that this man had an illness of the eyes whence
he became blind and saw the light no more.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb131">[<a href="#pb131">131</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now it befell that this man did not leave his wife, nor ever let her out of his reach,
for he feared she might go astray.
</p>
<p>Thus it chanced that a man of the countryside fell in love with this woman, and not
seeing how he could find an opportunity to converse with her—for her husband was always
at her side—he came near to losing his reason for love of her.
</p>
<p>And the woman seeing him so enamoured of her, said to him: you see, I can do nothing,
for this man never leaves me.
</p>
<p>So the good man did not know what to do or say. It seemed he would die for love. He
could find no way of meeting the woman alone.
</p>
<p>The woman, seeing the behaviour of this gentle man and all that he did, thought of
a way of helping him. She made a long tube of cane, and placed it to the ear of the
man, and spoke to him in this fashion so that her husband could not hear. And she
said to the good man: I am sorry for you, and I have thought of a way of helping you.
Go into the garden, and climb up a pear-tree which has many fine pears, and wait for
me up there, and I will come up to you.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb132">[<a href="#pb132">132</a>]</span></p>
<p>The good man went at once into the garden, and climbed up the pear-tree, and awaited
the woman.
</p>
<p>Now came the time when the woman was in the garden, and she wished to help the good
man, and her husband was still by her side, and she said: I have a fancy for those
pears which are at the top of that pear-tree, for they are very fine. And the husband
said: call some one to pluck them for you. And the woman said: I will pluck them myself;
otherwise I should not enjoy them.
</p>
<p>Then the woman approached the tree to climb it, and her husband came with her to the
foot of the tree, and he put his arms around the trunk of the tree, so that no one
could follow her up it.
</p>
<p>Now it happened that the woman climbed up the pear-tree to her friend, who was awaiting
her, and they were very happy together, and the pear-tree shook with their weight,
and the pears fell down on top of the husband.
</p>
<p>Then the husband said: what are you doing, woman, you are knocking all the pears down?
And the woman replied: I wanted the pears off a certain branch, and only so could
I get them.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb133">[<a href="#pb133">133</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now you must know that the Lord God and Saint Peter seeing this happening, Saint Peter
said to the Lord God: do you not see the trick that woman is playing on her husband?
Order that the husband see again, so he may perceive what his wife does.
</p>
<p>And the Lord God said: I tell you, Saint Peter, that no sooner does he see the light
than the woman will find an excuse, so I will that light come to him, and you shall
see what she will say.
</p>
<p>Then the light came to him, and he looked up and saw what the woman was doing. What

seen the light.

<h2 class="main">Here it is told of a gentleman whom the Emperor had hanged</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Emperor Frederick one day had a great nobleman hanged for a certain misdeed. And
that his justice might be visible to all, he had him <span class="pageNum" id="pb135">[<a href="#pb135">135</a>]</span>guarded by a noble knight with the severe command not to let him be removed; but the
knight paid little attention, and the hanged man was carried away.
</p>
<p>When the knight became aware of this, he took thought with himself as to what he might
do to save his head.
</p>
<p>And during the night, deep in thought, he went to a neighbouring abbey to see if he
could find some one newly buried there, that he might swing him from the gallows in
the other one’s place.
</p>
<p>That same night he reached the abbey, and found a woman in tears dishevelled and ungirt
and weeping loudly; and she was grievously afflicted and bewailed her dear husband
who had died that very day.
</p>
<p>The knight asked her softly: what manner of grief is this?
</p>
<p>And the lady replied: I loved him so much that I never wish to be consoled but desire
to end my days here in lamentation.
</p>
<p>Then the knight said to her: lady, what sense is there in this? Do you wish to die
here of <span class="pageNum" id="pb136">[<a href="#pb136">136</a>]</span>grief? Neither with tears nor with lamentations can you bring back to life a dead
body. Therefore what folly is this in which you are indulging? Do as I say: take me
to husband, for I have no wife, and save my life, for I am in danger. And I do not
know where to hide, for at my lord’s bidding I was guarding a knight who had been
hanged by the neck, and some men of his kindred carried him off. Show me how I may
escape, if you can, and I will be your husband and maintain you honourably.
</p>
<p>Then the woman, hearing this, fell in love with the knight, and said: I will do even
as you bid me; so great is the love I bear you. Let us take this husband of mine,
and draw him out of his sepulchre, and hang him in the place of the man who was taken
from you.
</p>
<p>And she ceased her plaint, and helped him to draw her husband from his grave, and
assisted him to hang him by the neck, dead as he was.
</p>
<p>The knight said: lady, he had one tooth missing from his mouth, and I fear that if
they came and saw him again, I might be dishonoured. And she, hearing this, broke
off a tooth from his <span class="pageNum" id="pb137">[<a href="#pb137">137</a>]</span>mouth, and if more had been required, she would have done it.
</p>
<p>Then the knight, seeing what she had done with her husband, said: lady, since you
showed so little regard for one towards whom you professed such love, so would you
have even less regard for me.
</p>
<p>Then he left her, and went about his business, and she remained behind in great shame.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3127src" href="#xd31e3127">1</a>

<h2 class="main">Here it is told how Charles of Anjou loved a lady</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Charles, the noble king of Sicily and Jerusalem, when he was Count of Anjou, loved
deeply the fair Countess of Teti, who in her turn loved the Count of Nevers.<a class="noteRef" id="n137.2src" href="#n137.2">1</a>
</p>
<p>At that time the King of France<a class="pseudoNoteRef" id="xd31e3151src" href="#n137.2">1</a> had forbidden all tourneying under pain of death.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb138">[<a href="#pb138">138</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Count of Anjou, wishing to put it to the proof whether he or the Count of Nevers
were more valiant in arms, took thought, and went most beseechfully to Messer Alardo
<span class="corr" id="xd31e3156" title="Source: de’Valleri">de’ Valleri</span> and told him of his love, saying that he had set his heart on measuring himself with
the Count of Nevers, and he begged him by the love he bore him to obtain leave of
the King that one sole tourney might be held with his licence. The other sought a
pretext.
</p>
<p>The Count of Anjou showed him the way. The King is almost a bigot, he said, and because
of the great goodness of your nature, he hopes to induce you to put on the habit of
a religious, that he may have your company. Therefore in putting this question, let
it be asked as a boon, that he allow you to hold a tournament. And you will do whatever
he wishes.
</p>
<p>And Messer Alardo replied: now tell me, Count, shall I give up all my knightly company
for a tourney?
</p>
<p>And the Count replied: I promise you loyally that I will release you from your pledge.
And so he did, as I shall tell you later.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb139">[<a href="#pb139">139</a>]</span></p>
<p>Messer Alardo went off to the King of France and said: Sire, when I took arms on the
day of your coronation, then all the best knights of the world did bear arms; wherefore,
since for love of you, I wish by all means to leave the world, and to don the religious
habit, so let it please you to grant me a boon, that a tournament may be held in which
all noble knights bear arms, so that I may forsake my arms in as great a feast as
that in which I took them up.
</p>
<p>Thereupon, the King gave the leave.
</p>
<p>A tournament was ordered.
</p>
<p>On one side, was the Count of Nevers, and on the other side was the Count of Anjou.
The Queen with countesses, ladies and damsels of high lineage were in the tribunes,
and the Countess of Teti was with them.
</p>
<p>On that day the flower of knighthood was in arms from one end of the world to the
other. After much tourneying, the Count of Anjou and he of Nevers had the field cleared<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3171src" href="#xd31e3171">2</a>, and moved against one another with all the force of their weighty chargers and with
great lances in their hands.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb140">[<a href="#pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now it chanced that in the midst of the field the steed of the Count of Nevers fell
with the Count all in a heap, and the ladies descended from the tribunes, and bore
him in their arms most tenderly.
</p>
<p>And the Countess of Teti was with them.
</p>
<p>The Count of Anjou lamented loudly, saying, alas! why did not my horse fall like that
of the Count of Nevers, so that the Countess might have been as close to me as she
was to him?
</p>
<p>When the tourney was ended, the Count of Anjou went to the Queen, and begged of her
a grace: that for love of the noble knights of France she would make a show of being
angry with the King, and when they made peace, she would ask him for a boon, and the
boon should be this: that it should be the King’s pleasure that the youthful knights
of France should not lose so noble a companion as Messer Alardo de’ Valleri.
</p>
<p>The Queen did as he said.
</p>
<p>She feigned anger with the king, and when they made peace, she asked him for her wish.
</p>
<p>And the King promised her a boon.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb141">[<a href="#pb141">141</a>]</span></p>
<p>And Messer Alardo was set free of his promise, and remained with the other noble knights
tourneying and performing feats of arms, so that his fame spread throughout the world
for his great skill and his most wonderful prowess.

<h2 class="main">Here it is told of the philosopher Socrates, and how he answered the Greeks</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Socrates was a noble Roman philosopher<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3191src" href="#xd31e3191">1</a>, and in his days the Greeks sent a great and noble embassy to the Romans.
</p>
<p>The purpose of their embassy was to adduce arguments to free themselves of the tribute
they paid to the Romans. And the Sultan gave them these instructions: go and make
use of arguments, <span class="corr" id="xd31e3202" title="Source: And">and</span> if necessary, use money.
</p>
<p>The ambassadors reached Rome.
</p>
<p>The purpose of their embassy was set forth in the Roman Council.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb142">[<a href="#pb142">142</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Roman Council decided that the reply to the Greeks’ question should be made by
the philosopher Socrates; it being decided without any further conditions that Rome
would stand by whatever Socrates answered.
</p>
<p>The ambassadors went to Socrates’ dwelling, very far from Rome, to set their arguments
before him.
</p>
<p>They arrived at his house, which was quite unpretending. They found him picking parsley.
They caught sight of him from a distance. He was a man of simple appearance. They
conversed with one another, and considered the above-mentioned facts. And they said
to one another: this man will be an easy bargain for us, for he seemed to them to
be poor rather than rich.
</p>
<p>They arrived and said: may God save you, O man of great wisdom, for so you must be
since the Romans have entrusted so weighty a matter as this to you.
</p>
<p>They showed him the decision of Rome, and said to him: we shall set our reasonable
arguments, which are many, before you. Your own sense will <span class="pageNum" id="pb143">[<a href="#pb143">143</a>]</span>ensure our rights. And know that we obey a rich master: you will take these <i>perperi</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3218src" href="#xd31e3218">2</a> which are many, and yet for our lord are nothing, though to you they may be very
useful.
</p>
<p>And Socrates answered the ambassadors, and said: first you will dine, and then we
will attend to your business.
</p>
<p>They accepted the invitation and dined very poorly without leaving a morsel.
</p>
<p>After dinner, Socrates spoke to the ambassadors and said: gentlemen, what is better,
one thing or two things? The ambassadors replied: two. And he said: now go to the
Romans with your persons, for if the city of Rome has the persons of the Greeks, it
will have their persons and their goods. And if I took the gold, the Romans would
lose their trust in me.
</p>
<p>Then the ambassadors left the philosopher, full of shame, and obeyed the Romans.

and his name was Baligante. One of the maids began to lie with him; then she spoke

</p>
<p>When the Countess heard how robust a man he was, she lay with him too.
</p>
<p>The lord found them out. He had the man killed, and made a pie of his heart, and presented
it to the Countess and her maids, and they ate of it.
</p>
<p>After the meal, the lord came to the hall, and asked how the pie had been. They all
answered: good! Then the lord said: it is no wonder, seeing that you liked Baligante
alive, that you should like him dead.
</p>
<p>And the Countess and the maids when they heard this, were ashamed, and saw clearly

<p>In the morning, when he rises, he finds water and fine linen, and when he has washed,
she prepares a needle for him with a silk thread, and he must pass the thread through
the eye of the needle, and if at the third trial he finds he cannot succeed, then
the women deprive him of all his chattels, and give him nothing back.
</p>
<p>And if at the third trial, he threads the needle, they give him back his arms, and
present him with beautiful jewels.

<h2 class="main">Of good King Meladius and the Knight Without Fear</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Good King Meladius and the Knight Without Fear were mortal enemies in the field.
</p>
<p>One day as this Knight Without Fear was wandering about disguised, after the manner
of knights-errant, he met his squires who loved him dearly, but who did not recognize
him.
</p>
<p>And they said: tell us O knight-errant, by the honour of chivalry, which is the better
knight, the Knight Without Fear or good King Meladius?
</p>
<p>And the knight answered: may God prosper me! King Meladius is the best knight who
ever mounted a saddle.
</p>
<p>Then the squires, who could not abide King Meladius, for love of their master, took
their lord by surprise, and lifted him thus armed from his saddle, and set him on
a jade, and said aloud that they were going to hang him.
</p>
<p>As they went on their way, they fell in with King Meladius. They found him disguised
as <span class="pageNum" id="pb147">[<a href="#pb147">147</a>]</span>a knight-errant on his way to a tournament, and he asked the fellows why they were
treating that knight so villainously.
</p>
<p>And they replied: Messer, because he has well deserved to die, and if you but knew
the reason, you would treat him worse yourself than we do. Ask him of his misdeed.
</p>
<p>King Meladius drew nearer and said: knight, what wrong have you done to these fellows
that they treat you so knavishly? And the knight replied: naught. No wrong have I
done to them unless it be that I favoured the cause of truth.
</p>
<p>Said King Meladius: that cannot be. Tell me more narrowly in what way you offended.
And he replied: gladly, sir. I was bent on my way, after the fashion of a knight-errant.
I came across these squires, and they asked me, by the truth of chivalry to say whether
good King Meladius or the Knight Without Fear were the better knight. And I, to favour,
as I said before, the cause of truth, said that King Meladius was the better, and
I spoke but to tell the truth, considering that King Meladius is my mortal <span class="pageNum" id="pb148">[<a href="#pb148">148</a>]</span>enemy, and I hate him mortally. I do not wish to lie. No other wrong have I done.
And therefore they at once treated me so shamefully.
</p>
<p>Then King Meladius <span class="corr" id="xd31e3288" title="Source: bagan">began</span> to beat the servants, and had the knight unbound, and gave him a rich charger with
his own arms (worked on the trappings) though they were covered, and he begged him
not to raise the cover before reaching his castle: and they departed, and each went
his way, King Meladius and the squires and the knight<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3291src" href="#xd31e3291">1</a>.
</p>
<p>In the evening, the knight reached the castle. He took the cover off the saddle. He
found the arms of King Meladius who had set him free so handsomely, and given him
a rich gift, and yet was his mortal enemy<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3296src" href="#xd31e3296">2</a>.

<h2 class="main">A tale told of the Court of Puy in Provence</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At the court of Puy-Notre-Dame in Provence, when the son of Count Raymond<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3306src" href="#xd31e3306">1</a> was made knight, a great court was held, to which were invited all good people, and
so many came willingly that the robes and silver ran short. And it was necessary to
have recourse to the knights of the feud itself that sufficient might be supplied
for the knights who came to the court. Some refused, and some gave with good grace.
</p>
<p>The day the feast was ordered a tame hawk was placed on a pole.
</p>
<p>Now it was arranged that whosoever felt himself a man of courage and means enough
and should take the hawk in his hand, should provide a feast for the court that year.
</p>
<p>The knights and squires all joyous and gay, made beautiful songs and poems, and four
judges were chosen that those which had merit might be rewarded.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb150">[<a href="#pb150">150</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then they sang and said much good of their lord.
</p>
<p>And their sons were noble knights and gentle.
</p>
<p>Then it happened that one of those knights (whose name was Messer Alamanno), a man
of much valour and goodness, loved a very beautiful woman of Provence who was called
Madonna Grigia; and he loved her so secretly that none could guess the truth.
</p>
<p>It came about that the squires of Puy plotted together to deceive him and make him
boast of his love. They spoke thus to certain knights and barons: we pray you that
at the first tournament which is held, it be ordered that there be boastings<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3319src" href="#xd31e3319">2</a>. For they thought: Messer So and So is a great knight, and will do well on the day
of the tourney, and will be exalted with delight. The knights will take up the boasts;
and he will not be able to hold himself from boasting of his lady.
</p>
<p>Thus it was ordered.
</p>
<p>The tournament took place. The knight won honour and was victorious. He was excited
with joy.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb151">[<a href="#pb151">151</a>]</span></p>
<p>In the repose of the evening, the knights began the boasts: such a one of a beautiful
castle; another of a fine goshawk; another of a lucky chance.
</p>
<p>And the knight could not hold himself from boasting that he had such a beautiful lady.
</p>
<p>Then it happened that he returned to pay her homage as was the custom. And the lady
dismissed him<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3331src" href="#xd31e3331">3</a>.
</p>
<p>The knight was all dismayed, and departed from her and the company of the knights
and went into a forest, and shut himself up in a hermitage, so secret that none knew
of it.
</p>
<p>Then anyone who had seen the grief of the knights and the ladies and the damsels who
constantly lamented the loss of so noble a knight might well have felt pity.
</p>
<p>One day it came about that the young squires of Puy lost their prey and their bearings
during a hunt, and chanced upon the aforesaid hermitage. The knight asked them if
they were from Puy. They replied yes. He asked them for news.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb152">[<a href="#pb152">152</a>]</span></p>
<p>And the squires began to tell him how they had sad tidings; how for a small misdeed
they had lost the flower of knights, and how this lady had dismissed him, and no one
knew what had become of him. But soon, they said, a tournament will be proclaimed
at which there will be many good people, and we think that he has so gentle a heart,
that wherever he may be, he will come and joust with us<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3341src" href="#xd31e3341">4</a>. And we have marshalled guards of great strength and knowledge who will surely bring
him back. So we hope to regain our great loss.
</p>
<p>Then the hermit wrote to a faithful friend of his to send him secretly on the day
of the tournament arms and a horse. And he sent away the squires.
</p>
<p>The friend supplied the needs of the hermit, and on the day of the tournament sent
him arms and a horse, and it was the day of the challenges between the knights, and
he won the prize at the tournament.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb153">[<a href="#pb153">153</a>]</span></p>
<p>The guards saw him and recognized him. They bore him among them in triumph. And the
people rejoiced, and lowered his visor, and begged him for love that he would sing.
And he replied: I shall never sing unless I am at peace with my lady.
</p>
<p>Then the noble knights were persuaded to go to the lady, and begged her that she would
pardon him.
</p>
<p>The lady replied: tell him I will never pardon him unless a hundred barons and a hundred
knights, a hundred ladies and a hundred damsels shall cry to me with one voice for
mercy, and know not to whom they cry.
</p>
<p>Then the knight, who was a man of great wisdom, bethought himself that the feast of
Candlemass was approaching, when there would be great rejoicing in Puy, and all good
folk would go to the monastery. And he argued<span class="corr" id="xd31e3354" title="Source: ;">:</span> my lady will be there and many good people, such as she (Madonna Grigia) has asked
herself shall cry out to her for mercy.
</p>
<p>Then he composed a very beautiful song; and in the morning early went up into the
pulpit <span class="pageNum" id="pb154">[<a href="#pb154">154</a>]</span>and began to sing his song as best he knew, and well he knew how to sing it, and thus
it ran:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Like the stag which has run a great course and comes to die ’mid the sound of the
hunters’ cries, so, lady, to your pity, I turn.…<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3364src" href="#xd31e3364">5</a></p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>Then all the folk who were in the church cried out mercy, and the lady pardoned him.
</p>
<p>And he entered into her good grace as he had been before.

<h2 class="main">Here it is told of Queen Iseult and Messer Tristan of Lyonesse</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Messer Tristan of Cornwall loved Iseult the fair<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3391src" href="#xd31e3391">1</a>, who was King Mark’s wife, and between them they fashioned a love signal in this
wise: that when Messer Tristan wished to speak to her, <span class="pageNum" id="pb155">[<a href="#pb155">155</a>]</span>he went to a garden of the king where there stood a fountain, and he muddied the water
of the rivulet made by the fountain: which rivulet passed by the palace where the
lady Iseult lived.
</p>
<p>So when she saw the water disturbed, she knew that Messer Tristan was at the fountain.
</p>
<p>Now it happened that an inquisitive gardener<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3405src" href="#xd31e3405">2</a> perceived the plan in such a manner that the two lovers could in no way be aware
of his knowledge.
</p>
<p>This gardener went to King Mark and told him everything as it had happened. King Mark
believed him.
</p>
<p>He ordered a hunt, and separated from his knights as though he had lost his way. The
knights searched for him, wandering about the forest. King Mark climbed up the pine
tree which stood above the fountain where Tristan spoke with the queen.
</p>
<p>And King Mark staying in the pine-tree at night, Messer Tristan came to the fountain
and disturbed its water.
</p>
<p>A little while after, the queen came to the fountain. And by chance she had a happy
<span class="pageNum" id="pb156">[<a href="#pb156">156</a>]</span>thought to look at the pine-tree. And she saw that its shadow was deeper than usual.
Then the queen became afraid, and being afraid, she stopped and spoke with Tristan
in this manner and said: disloyal knight, I have made you come here to complain of
your misdeed, for never was such disloyalty in a knight as you have shown by your
words which have dishonoured me, and your uncle king Mark who has loved you so much.
And you have been saying things about me among the wandering knights that could never
have place in my heart. I would give myself to the flames should I dishonour so noble
a king as my lord the king Mark. Therefore I no longer recognise you as my knight,
and I dismiss you as an unloyal knight with all my force and with no respect.
</p>
<p>Tristan, hearing these words, doubted strongly, and said: my lady, if some malicious
knights of Cornwall speak of me in this fashion, I say first of all that I was never
guilty of such things. May it please your ladyship, but by the Lord, these knights
are envious of me. I have never said or done anything that meant dishonour for you
or <span class="pageNum" id="pb157">[<a href="#pb157">157</a>]</span>for my uncle, the king Mark. But since it is your pleasure, I will obey your commands.
I will go away to other parts to end my days. And maybe before I die, the malicious
knights of Cornwall will have felt need of me as they did at the time of Amoroldo<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3419src" href="#xd31e3419">3</a>, when I delivered them and their lands from a vile and painful servitude.
</p>
<p>And he went away without saying another word.
</p>
<p>King Mark who was above the two when he heard this, grew glad with a great gladness.
</p>
<p>When morning came, Tristan made feint to go riding. He had horses and pack mules shod.
Valets ran to and fro, some carrying saddles, others bridles. The commotion was great.
</p>
<p>The king grew angry at Tristan’s departure, and summoned his barons and knights. He
sent an order to Tristan not to depart without his leave under pain of incurring his
displeasure. Thus ordered the king, and so vigorously, that <span class="pageNum" id="pb158">[<a href="#pb158">158</a>]</span>the queen sent to Tristan and bade him not to go.
</p>
<p>And so Tristan remained there, and did not depart.
</p>
<p>Nor was he surprised or deceived again owing to the shrewd circumspection that grew
up between the two.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Papirius was a Roman, a powerful man, wise and very fond of war. And the Romans wishing
to defend themselves against Alexander, put their trust in the valour of this Papirius.
</p>
<p>When Papirius was a child, his father took him with him to the council. One day the
council ordered that its sittings should be kept secret. And his mother, who wanted
to know what the Romans had been discussing, plied him with many questions.
</p>
<p>Papirius perceiving the desire of his mother, concocted a splendid lie, and said thus:
the Romans were discussing which was better: for the men to have two wives, or the
women two husbands, so that the race may multiply to meet those who are rebellious
against Rome. The council decided that it was better and more convenient that the
men should have two wives.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb160">[<a href="#pb160">160</a>]</span></p>
<p>The mother, who had promised the boy to keep the matter a secret, told the thing to
another woman, who told it to yet another.
</p>
<p>Thus it went from one to another until all Rome knew of it. The women came together
and went to the senators, and made great complaint. And they feared still graver novelties.
Hearing the complaints, they courteously dismissed the women, and commended Papirius
for his wisdom.
</p>
<p>And then the commune of Rome decided that no father should take his son with him to
council<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3454src" href="#xd31e3454">1</a>.

<p>There came to him one day a young man with a singular question. Master, he said, I
have seen a thing which much displeases my mind. I have seen an old man ripe in years
doing wanton follies. Now if the cause of such things be age, <span class="pageNum" id="pb161">[<a href="#pb161">161</a>]</span>I have decided to die young. Therefore for the love of God give me counsel, if you
can.
</p>
<p>Aristotle replied: I cannot do other than tell you that when the nature of man grows
old, the good natural heat changes into weakness, while the reasonable virtue fails
and alters<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3468src" href="#xd31e3468">1</a>. For your instruction I will teach you what I can. Do so that in your youth you practice
all beautiful, pleasant and honest things, and guard yourself from indulging in what
is contrary to these; so when you are old, you will live without evil, not from nature

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Emperor Trajan was a most just lord.
</p>
<p>Going one day with his host of cavalry against his enemies, a widow woman came before
him, and taking hold of his stirrup said: Sire, render me justice against those who
have wrongfully put <span class="pageNum" id="pb162">[<a href="#pb162">162</a>]</span>my son to death. And the Emperor answered: I will give you satisfaction when I return.
And the woman said<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3480src" href="#xd31e3480">1</a>: and if you do not return? To which he replied: my successor will give you satisfaction.
And if your successor should fail me, you will be my debtor. And supposing that he
give me satisfaction, the fact of another man rendering me justice will not absolve
you of blame. Moreover, your successor may have enough to do to think of himself.
</p>
<p>Then the Emperor got down from his horse, and did justice on those who had killed
the woman’s son, and then rode off and defeated his enemies.
</p>
<p>And not a long time after his death<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3486src" href="#xd31e3486">2</a> there came holy Saint Gregory the pope, and learning of his work of justice, went
to his monument. And with tears in his eyes, he honoured the Emperor with mighty praise
and had him disinterred. It was found that all the body had turned to dust save the
bones and the tongue.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb163">[<a href="#pb163">163</a>]</span></p>
<p>And this showed how just a man he had been, and how justly he had spoken.
</p>
<p>And Saint Gregory prayed to God for him. And it is related that by evident miracle,
owing to the prayers of this holy pope, the soul of the Emperor was freed from the
torments of hell and passed into eternal life, pagan though he had been<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3493src" href="#xd31e3493">3</a>.

<h2 class="main">Here it is told how Seneca consoled a woman whose son had died<span id="xd31e3525"></span></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Seneca wishing to console a woman whose son had died, as we read in the Book of Consolation<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3528src" href="#xd31e3528">1</a>, he said these words: if you were a woman <span class="pageNum" id="pb165">[<a href="#pb165">165</a>]</span>like other women, I should not speak to you as I am going to speak. But for the fact
that you, though woman, have the intellect of a man, I will speak to you so. There
were two women in Rome, and the son of each of them died. One was one of the dearest
lads in the world, and the other was most lovable, too. One woman let herself receive
consolation, and was content to be consoled; the other woman hid herself in a corner
of the house and refused every consolation, and gave herself to tears. Which of these
two acted the more wisely? If you say she who was willing to be consoled, you say
rightly. Therefore, why weep? If you tell me: I weep for my son, because his goodness
did me honour, I tell you you are not mourning him, but rather your own loss, whence
it is for yourself you are weeping, and it is a very ugly thing to weep over oneself.
And if you will say to me: my heart is weeping because I loved him so much, it is
not true, for you love him less now that he is dead, than when he was alive. And if
your grief be for love, why did you not weep when he was alive, knowing that he had
to die? Hence, do not excuse yourself: <span class="pageNum" id="pb166">[<a href="#pb166">166</a>]</span>cease your tears. If your son is dead, it cannot be otherwise. Death is second nature,
and therefore a thing meet and necessary for all.
</p>
<p>And so he consoled her.
</p>
<p>We read further of Seneca that being Nero’s master, he beat him when he was young
and his scholar, and when Nero was made emperor, he remembered the beatings received
from Seneca, and he had him taken and condemned to death.
</p>
<p>But he did him the favour of letting him choose what kind of death he would have.
</p>
<p>And Seneca chose to have his veins opened in a hot bath.
</p>
<p>And his wife wept and cried out: alas! my lord, what grief that you should die for
no fault of yours.
</p>
<p>And Seneca replied: it is better that I should die without fault than through some
fault of mine. For then he who kills me wrongfully would be excused.

why do you complain? Is it because I leave you?

<h2 class="main">How the Sultan being in need of money, sought to find occasion to proceed against
a Jew</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Sultan, being in need of money, was advised to proceed against a rich Jew, who
lived in his country, and to try to take away his substance from him.
</p>
<p>The Sultan sent for this Jew and asked him what was the best religion, thinking he
will say surely the Jewish faith, when I will tell him that he sins against mine.
And if he says the Saracen, I will ask him why he is a Jew.
</p>
<p>The Jew, hearing the question, replied: Sire, there was a father who had three sons,
and he had a ring with a precious stone, one of the finest in the world. Each of the
sons begged this father that he should leave him this ring at his death. The father,
seeing that each of them desired it, sent for a good jeweller and said to him: master,
make me two rings just like this one, and set in <span class="pageNum" id="pb169">[<a href="#pb169">169</a>]</span>each of them a stone resembling this one. The jeweller made the rings so that no one
knew the real gem apart save the father. He sent for his sons one by one, and to each
he gave a ring in secret, and each believed he had the true ring, and no one knew
the truth save the father. And so I tell you of the faiths which are three. God above
knows best of all, and his sons who are ourselves each of us thinks he has the true
one.
</p>
<p>Then the Sultan hearing the man get out of the difficulty in this manner, did not
know how to entrap him, and let him go<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3564src" href="#xd31e3564">1</a>.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A vassal of a lord who held his lands, it being at the season of the new figs, and
the lord walking through his land, saw a fine ripe fig at the top of a fig-tree. The
lord told the vassal to pluck it for him.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb170">[<a href="#pb170">170</a>]</span></p>
<p>The vassal then thought: since he likes them, I will keep them for him. So he tended
the tree and watched it carefully.
</p>
<p>When the figs were ripe, he brought the lord a basketful, thinking so to win his favour.
But when he brought them, the season was past, and there was such an abundance of
figs that they were almost given to the swine.
</p>
<p>The lord, seeing the figs, grew indignant, and ordered his servants to bind the vassal
and take the figs from him and to throw them one by one in his face. And when a fig
came near his eye, he cried out: my lord, I thank you.
</p>
<p>The servants owing to the strangeness of this, went and told their lord who said:
why did he say so? And the man answered: Sire, because I had in mind to bring peaches,
and if I had brought them, I should now be blind.
</p>
<p>Then the lord began to laugh, and had the man unbound and gave him wherewith to dress
himself again, and made him a present for the novel thing he had said<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3588src" href="#xd31e3588">1</a>.

<h2 class="main">How the Lord entered into partnership with a minstrel</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Lord once formed a partnership with a minstrel.
</p>
<p>Now it befell one day that it had been made known that wedding festivities were to
be held, and it had also been made known that a rich man had died. The minstrel said:
I will go to the wedding, and you shall go the funeral. The Lord went to the funeral,
and succeeded in raising the dead man. He received a reward of one hundred ducats.
</p>
<p>The minstrel went to the wedding, and ate his fill. And he returned home, and found
his companion, who had earned his reward. He praised him. The Lord had eaten nothing.
The minstrel obtained some money from him, and bought a fat kid, and roasted it. And
as he roasted it, he drew out the kidneys, and ate them.
</p>
<p>When it was set before his companion, the latter asked for the kidneys. The minstrel
replied: the kids in this region have no kidneys.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb172">[<a href="#pb172">172</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now it befell, on another occasion, that another wedding was announced, and another
rich man died. And God said: this time I wish to go the wedding, and do you go to
the funeral; and I will show you how to raise the dead man. You shall make the sign
of the cross on him, and you shall bid him to rise, and he will arise. But first of
all, let them promise you a reward. The minstrel said: indeed, so I will.
</p>
<p>He went, and promised to raise him; but he did not rise, for all his signing.
</p>
<p>The dead man was the son of a great lord.
</p>
<p>The father waxed wroth, seeing that this man was making a mock of him. He sent him
away to be hanged by the neck.
</p>
<p>The Lord went out to meet him, and said: Do not fear, for I will raise him; but tell
me, on your honour, who did eat the kidneys of the kid? The minstrel replied: By that
holy world whither I must go, oh my partner, I did not eat them. The Lord, seeing
that he could not make him confess, had pity on him. So he went, and raised the dead
man. And the other was set free, and received the recompense that he had been <span class="pageNum" id="pb173">[<a href="#pb173">173</a>]</span>promised. They returned home. The Lord said: O my partner, I wish to leave you, because
I have not found you to be as loyal as I thought you were.
</p>
<p>And he, seeing that it must be so perforce, said: I am content. Do you divide, and
I will take my share. The Lord divided the money into three parts. And the minstrel
said: What are you doing? We are but two. Said the Lord: That is indeed so; but this
one part shall belong to him who ate the kidneys, and the others shall be, one yours
and one mine.
</p>
<p>Then the minstrel said: By my faith, since you speak this, I must indeed tell you
that I did eat them. I am so old, that I may tell no more lies. And so such things
can be proved for money, which a man will confess who would not confess them in order
to save his own life<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3616src" href="#xd31e3616">1</a>.

<p class="first">Good King Richard of England once crossed the seas with his barons, counts and brave
and valiant knights, but he brought no horses, and so he arrived in the land of the
Sultan.
</p>
<p>And it came about that he gave the order for battle, and made such a great killing
of the Saracens that the nurses say there to the children when they cry: Here comes
King Richard, for like death was he feared.
</p>
<p>They tell that the Sultan seeing his men fly, asked: how many are these Christians
who do such great slaughter, and they answered him: Sire, there is only King Richard
with his folk. Then the Sultan said: May God forbid that so noble a man as King Richard
should go on foot. He ordered a fine steed to be sent to him.
</p>
<p>The messenger brought the fine steed and said: Sire, the Sultan sends you this horse
so that you need not remain on foot.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb175">[<a href="#pb175">175</a>]</span></p>
<p>But the King was wise, and ordered a squire of his to mount the horse that he might
try it.
</p>
<p>And this the squire did. The horse was trained to come back to the Sultan’s camp.
The horseman could not hold it in, for it raced with all its might to the Sultan’s
pavilion. The Sultan had been expecting to see King Richard, but he did not come.

<p>Thus we see that we should have little trust in the kind offers of our enemies.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Messer Rinieri of Monte Nero<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3643src" href="#xd31e3643">1</a>, a knight of the court, went to Sardinia, and dwelt with the lord of Alborea, and
fell in love with a Sardinian lady who was very beautiful. He lay with her. The husband
found them out. He did them no harm, but went to his lord, and made great complaint.
</p>
<p>The Lord loved this Sardinian. He sent for Messer Rinieri; he spoke to him words of
severe <span class="pageNum" id="pb176">[<a href="#pb176">176</a>]</span>menace. And Messer Rinieri begged his pardon, and told him to send for the woman,
and to ask her, whether what she had done was for aught but for love. The lord did
not like to be made fun of. He ordered him to leave the country under penalty of his
life. And not having yet been rewarded for his services, Messer Rinieri said: May
it please you to send to Pisa to your seneschal to provide for me. That will I do
right gladly. He wrote him a letter and gave it to him.
</p>
<p>Now when he had reached Pisa, and went to the aforesaid seneschal, and sat at table
with many noble persons, he narrated what had happened, and then gave this letter
to the seneschal. This man read it, and found that he was to give him a pair of linen
hose without feet, and nothing else. And he wished to receive them before all the
knights present.
</p>
<p>When he had them, there was great merriment and much laughter. He was not at all angered
by this, for he was an exceedingly gentle knight.
</p>
<p>Now it befell that he entered into a boat with a horse and a servant of his, and returned
to Sardinia.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb177">[<a href="#pb177">177</a>]</span></p>
<p>One day when his lord was riding out with other knights, he met Messer Rinieri who
was tall and had long legs, and was sitting on a worn jade, and had these linen hose
on his legs. The lord recognised him, and with angry mien sent for him, to come before
him, and said: What does this mean, Messer Rinieri, why have you not left Sardinia?
Certes, said Messer Rinieri. I did but return for the feet of the hose. He stretched
out his legs, and showed his feet.
</p>
<p>Then the lord was amused, and laughed, and forgave him, and presented him with the
robe that he wore, and said: Messer Rinieri, you have been wiser than I, and know
more than I taught you. And he rejoined: Messer, that redounds to your honour.

<p class="first">There was a lord who had a player at his court, and this player adored his lord as
though he were his god.
</p>
<p>Another player of the court, seeing this, spoke ill of him and said: who is this man
whom you call your god? He is nobody. And the first, <span class="pageNum" id="pb179">[<a href="#pb179">179</a>]</span>being bold for the favour he enjoyed of his lord, beat the other fellow unmercifully.
This man, being unable to defend himself, went to complain to the lord and related
the whole event.
</p>
<p>The lord made a jest of the matter.
</p>
<p>The beaten jongleur went away, and hid himself among people of mean rank, for he feared
to remain among better folk for the shame that had come to him.
</p>
<p>Now it happened that the lord heard of this and was displeased, so that he decided
to dismiss his player and send him away.
</p>
<p>It was the custom in this court that when a man received a present from his lord he
knew himself dismissed from service. The lord took a great deal of money and placed
it in a tart, and when his jongleur came before him, he gave it him, saying to himself:
since I am constrained to discharge him, I want him to be a wealthy man.
</p>
<p>When the jongleur saw the tart, he became distressed. He thought and said to himself:
I have eaten; I will keep it and give it to my landlady.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb180">[<a href="#pb180">180</a>]</span></p>
<p>Taking it with him to the inn, he found there the man whom he had beaten, and he was
wretched and sad. The player feeling pity for him, went towards him, and gave him
the tart. And he took it, and went off with it, and was well repaid for the punishment
he had taken from the other.
</p>
<p>Then the jongleur going back to his lord to take farewell of him, the lord said: what,
you are still here? Did you not have the tart? Sir, I had it. What did you do with
it? Sir, I had eaten then. I gave it to a poor court player, who spoke ill of me because
I called you my god.
</p>
<p>Then the lord said: go and bad fortune go with you, for certainly his god is a better
one than yours.
</p>
<p>And he told him all about the tart.
</p>
<p>The jongleur felt himself lost, and did not know what to do. He separated from his
lord and had nothing further from him.
</p>
<p>And he went out to seek for the man to whom he had given the tart.
</p>
<p>Nor was it true that he ever found him.

<p>Since the pilgrim was unable to pay, he was bound and blindfolded, as is the custom
of that place.
</p>
<p>When he was led through the town to the place of punishment, a woman, who had great

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When the sons of king Priam had re-made Troy, which the Greeks had destroyed, and
Talamon and Agamemnon had taken the lady Hesione, the sons of Priam called a meeting
of their powerful allies and spoke so among their friends: dear friends, the Greeks
have done us a great wrong. They have killed our folk, and destroyed our city, and
our lady they have taken away. And we have re-made our city and strengthened it. Our
alliance is a powerful one. Moreover, we have <span class="pageNum" id="pb183">[<a href="#pb183">183</a>]</span>gathered together no little treasure. Now let us send and tell them they must make
amend for the injuries done us, that they must give us back our lady. And this Paris
said.
</p>
<p>Then the good Hector who surpassed in valour at that time all the valorous men, spoke
thus: my lords, war is not to my liking, nor do I advise it, for the Greeks are more
powerful than we are. They have valour and wealth and science, and so we are not in
a position to combat them, for this great strength of theirs. And I say this not from
cowardice. For if it shall be that the war cannot be avoided, I will uphold my part
in it like anyone else. And I will support the weight of the battle. And this is against
those who would make the enterprise.
</p>
<p>Now the war came about. Hector was in the battle together with the Trojans, and was
as valiant as a lion. And with his own hands he killed more than two thousand of the
Greeks.
</p>
<p>Hector killed the Greeks and supported the Trojans and escaped death.
</p>
<p>But in the end Hector was slain, and the Trojans abandoned every defence. The bold
<span class="pageNum" id="pb184">[<a href="#pb184">184</a>]</span>spirits who had urged the war grew fainter in their hardihood, and Troy was again

she came to death thereby, and she commanded that when her soul had left her body,
a rich boat should be prepared to be covered with a vermilion cloth, and a fine bed
laid therein with rich and noble coverings of silk and adorned with precious stones.

that is my lord Sir Lancelot of the Lake, whom I did not know how to beg that he should
have pity on me. So I died there for loving well as you can see.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Christ one day going with his disciples through a deserted place, the disciples who
followed Him saw some great pieces of fine gold shining there.
</p>
<p>So they, calling Christ, and marvelling that He had not stayed to observe, said to
Him: Lord, let us take this gold which will serve us for many needs.
</p>
<p>And Christ turned to them and reproved them and said: you want those things which
take from <span class="pageNum" id="pb187">[<a href="#pb187">187</a>]</span>our kingdom the greatest number of souls. And that this is true, on our return you
will see the proof.
</p>
<p>And He passed on.
</p>
<p>A little while after, two dear companions found the gold and were greatly rejoiced
thereat, and one went to the nearest village to get a mule, while the other remained
on guard.
</p>
<p>Now listen to the guilty deeds that followed the guilty thoughts sent them by the
devil<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3769src" href="#xd31e3769">1</a>. The one with the mule returned and said to his companion: I have eaten in the village,
and you must be hungry. Eat these two fine breads and then we will load up. The other
replied: I have no great will to eat now. Therefore, let us load up first.
</p>
<p>And they began to load the mule.
</p>
<p>And when they had almost finished loading, the one who had gone for the mule bent
down to tie the bundle fast, and the other ran behind him treacherously with a pointed
knife, and killed him. Then he gave one of the breads to the mule, and ate the other
himself. The bread was <span class="pageNum" id="pb188">[<a href="#pb188">188</a>]</span>poisoned. The man fell down dead, and so did the mule, before they could leave the
spot, and the gold remained untouched as it had been before<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3782src" href="#xd31e3782">2</a>.

<h2 class="main">How Messer Azzolino Romano arranged a great charity</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Messer Azzolino Romano once announced a great charity in his territory, and invited
the people there and elsewhere to attend.
</p>
<p>And so all the poor men and women were summoned to his meadows on a certain day, that
each should be given a new habit and plenty to eat. The news spread abroad. Folk came
from all parts.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb189">[<a href="#pb189">189</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the day of the assembly arrived, the seneschals<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3808src" href="#xd31e3808">1</a> were ready with the clothes and the food, and each person was made to undress and
cast off his old shoes, when new clothes were given and food handed out.
</p>
<p>The poor people wanted their old clothes back, but it was of no avail, for they were
all piled up in a heap and fire was laid thereto.
</p>
<p>Then so much gold and silver were given as compensated them, and they were told to
go home in the name of God.
</p>
<p>It was in his<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3815src" href="#xd31e3815">2</a> time that a certain peasant charged a neighbour with having stolen his cherries.
When the accused appeared, he said: send and see if that be true, for the cherry tree
is covered with fruit. Then Messer Azzolino had proof that this was so, and condemned
the accuser to pay a sum of money, telling the other to look after his cherries rather
than rely on his lord’s justice.
</p>
<p>And the man decided to do this.
</p>
<p>For fear of his tyranny, a woman brought him a sack of walnuts of splendid quality.
And dressed <span class="pageNum" id="pb190">[<a href="#pb190">190</a>]</span>up as well as she could contrive, she reached the spot when he<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3823src" href="#xd31e3823">3</a> was with his knights and said: Sire, may God give you long life.
</p>
<p>And he was suspicious and asked: why do you say so? She replied: because if it is
so, we shall have a long rest. And Azzolino laughed and ordered that she be given
and put on a fine skirt which came to her knees, and he made her hold it up and had
all the nuts scattered on the floor, and then he made the woman pick them up again
one by one and place them in the sack, and then he rewarded her handsomely.
</p>
<p>In Lombardy and the Marches, the pans are called pots<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3830src" href="#xd31e3830">4</a>. Azzolino’s retainers had, out of mischief, taken a potter one day to bring him to
judgment, and Messer Azzolino was in the room. He said: who is this man? Some one
answered: Sire, he is a potter. Go and hang him then. <span class="pageNum" id="pb191">[<a href="#pb191">191</a>]</span>But, sire, he is a potter. Therefore I say go and hang him. Sire, we are only saying
that he is a potter. Well, I say again that you take him and hang him.
</p>
<p>Then the judge perceived the origin of the misunderstanding. And he explained it,
but it was of no avail for Azzolino had said it three times, and the man had to be
hung.
</p>
<p>It would take too long to tell how feared he was, and it is within the knowledge of
many.
</p>
<p>It is recorded how one day being with the Emperor on horseback with all their followers,
the two of them made a challenge which had the finer sword. The Emperor drew his sword
from its sheath, and it was magnificently ornamented with gold and precious stones.
</p>
<p>Then said Messer Azzolino: it is very fine, but mine is finer by far.
</p>
<p>And he drew it forth.
</p>
<p>Then six hundred knights who were with him all drew forth theirs. When the Emperor
saw the swords, he said that Azzolino’s was the finer.
</p>
<p>Azzolino was taken in battle at a place which <span class="pageNum" id="pb192">[<a href="#pb192">192</a>]</span>is called Casciano<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3859src" href="#xd31e3859">5</a>, and he banged his head so hard against the pole supporting the tent where he was
imprisoned and bound, that he killed himself.

they would have bread from the commune.
</p>
<p>Everybody went, and it was a great marvel, and this was because many who were not
in need disguised themselves as beggars.
</p>
<p>And the officials said to the people: we cannot distinguish between all these folk,

the women and children <span class="pageNum" id="pb193">[<a href="#pb193">193</a>]</span>on to that other, and all must go aboard. The sailors set to work at once, and put
their oars into the water, and bore the folk off to Sardinia.

she had discovered a very strange beast<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4005src" href="#xd31e4005">1</a>, and did not know its name. The wolf said: let us go and see it. And they came to
it. To the wolf it appeared very strange. The fox asked it its name. The mule replied:
to tell the truth I cannot remember very well, but if you can read, you will find
it written on my back right hoof. The fox replied: never mind, I cannot read, much
as I should like to. The wolf then took up: leave it to me, for I can read very well
indeed. The mule then showed his right hoof, the cleaving whereof seemed like letters.
The wolf said: I cannot see them very well. The mule answered: come a little closer,
for the letters are very small. The wolf came nearer and looked closely. The mule
then gave him a kick which killed him.

<p class="first">A peasant from the country came to Florence to buy a doublet. He asked at a shop where
the proprietor was. He was not there. But a youth in the shop said: I am the master;
what is it you want? I want a doublet. The youth found him one. Try it on, he said.
They argued over the price. The countryman had only a quarter of the money. The apprentice,
pretending to help him with the doublet, sewed the man’s shirt to it and then said:
take it off. And the other removed it, remaining naked.

<p>The other apprentices were ready with sticks and they chased and beat the man all

<h2 class="label">XCVI</h2>
<h2 class="main">Here it is told of Bito and Messer Frulli of San Giorgio near Florence</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Bito was a Florentine and a fine courtier, and dwelt at San Giorgio beyond the city.
There <span class="pageNum" id="pb202">[<a href="#pb202">202</a>]</span>was also an old man called Ser Frulli, who had a farm over at San Giorgio which was
very pleasant, so that he lived there almost the whole year with his family, and every
morning he sent his servant to sell fruit and vegetables at the market by the bridge.
</p>
<p>And he was so miserly and suspicious that he made up the bundles of the vegetables,
and counted them over to the servant, and then counted over all that she brought back.
</p>
<p>His especial warning to her was not to loiter in San Giorgio, because there were women
thieves there.
</p>
<p>One morning the servant passed with her basketful of cabbages. Bito, who had thought
the thing out beforehand, had put on his finest fur coat. And sitting by the bench
outside, he called the serving-maid who went over to him unthinkingly, and many women
had called her even before this, but she had not wished to go to them.
</p>
<p>Good woman, he said: how do you sell these cabbages? Two for a <i>danaio</i><a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4039src" href="#xd31e4039">1</a>. Surely that is <span class="pageNum" id="pb203">[<a href="#pb203">203</a>]</span>cheap. But I tell you, said Bito, there are only myself and my servant in the house,
for all my family are in the town; and two bunches are too much. Moreover, I like
them fresh.
</p>
<p>At this time, there were in use in Florence the <i>medaglie</i>, two of which were worth a <i>danaio</i>. Bito said: you pass by every morning; give me a bunch now and give me a <i>danaio</i>, and take this <i>medaglia</i>, and to-morrow morning when you return, you can give me the other bunch. It seemed
to the woman that what he said was right, and so she did as he asked.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4058src" href="#xd31e4058">2</a> Then she went off to sell the rest of her vegetables at the price which her master
had fixed. She returned home and gave Messer Frulli the money. He, counting it over
several times, found it a <i>danaio</i> short. And he told the servant. She replied: it cannot be so.
</p>
<p>Then the master, getting angry with her, asked her if she had not dallied at San Giorgio.
She sought to deny the fact, but he plied her so with questions, that she admitted:
yes, I stopped for a fine gentleman, who paid me properly. And I must tell you that
I have still to give him a <span class="pageNum" id="pb204">[<a href="#pb204">204</a>]</span>bunch of cabbages.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4068src" href="#xd31e4068">3</a> Messer Frulli replied: so you are now a <i>danaio</i> out.
</p>
<p>He thought over the matter, and perceived the trick, and spoke very roughly to the
servant, and asked where the man lived exactly.
</p>
<p>And she told him.
</p>
<p>He perceived then it was Bito, who had already played some tricks on him.
</p>
<p>Burning with rage, he got up early next morning, and put a rusty sword under his coat,
and came to the head of the bridge, and there found Bito sitting in company of many
excellent folk. He drew out the sword, and would have wounded his man, if some one
had not held him by the arm. The people were amazed, wondering what was the matter,
and Bito was mightily afraid. But then remembering what had happened, he began to
smile.
</p>
<p>The folk who were standing around Messer Frulli asked him what it was all about. He
told them breathlessly as best he could. Bito ordered the people to stand back (for
he said), I want to <span class="pageNum" id="pb205">[<a href="#pb205">205</a>]</span>come to an explanation with you. Let us have no more words about it. Give me back
my <i>danaio</i> and keep your <i>medaglia</i>. And keep the cabbage with God’s curse on it. Messer Frulli said: it pleases me well
so. And if you had said this before, all this would not have happened.
</p>
<p>And not perceiving the trick, he gave him a <i>danaio</i> and took a <i>medaglia</i>, and went away content.
</p>
<p>There was great laughter thereat.

the bottom, but none in the middle. He sold the <span class="pageNum" id="pb206">[<a href="#pb206">206</a>]</span>water for wine, and doubled his gains, and as soon as he was paid, he got aboard a
ship with his money. And by the will of God there was a big monkey aboard the ship,
who took the money from the merchant’s pocket, and climbed up to the top of the mast
with it.
</p>
<p>The man, fearing that the monkey might throw the purse into the sea, went after it,
trying to coax it. The beast sat down and opened the purse with his mouth, and took
out the gold pieces one by one. He threw first one in to the sea and let another fall
on to the deck. And he so acted that one half of the money remained on the ship, which
was the just gain of the merchant.

<h2 class="label">XCIX</h2>
<h2 class="main">Here is told a pretty tale of love</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A young man of Florence loved a gentle virgin carnally. She did not love him at all,
but loved another youth beyond measure, who loved her too, but not nearly so much
as the first one.
</p>
<p>And this was evident, for the other had abandoned everything, and had worn himself
out, and was quite beside himself; and especially on those days when he did not see
her.
</p>
<p>A friend of his was sorry for him. After much persuasion he took him away to a most
pleasant place; and there they stayed quietly for a fortnight.
</p>
<p>In the meantime, the girl quarrelled with her mother. She sent her maid-servant, and
let her tell him whom she loved that she desired to elope <span class="pageNum" id="pb208">[<a href="#pb208">208</a>]</span>with him. He was exceedingly glad. The maid said: she desires you to come on horse-back
when it is fully night; she will pretend to go down to the cellars. You will be ready
at the door, and she will leap on to the horse behind you; she is light, and can ride
well. He replied: I am well agreed.
</p>
<p>When they had thus arranged matters, he prepared everything at a place of his. And
there were his friends with him, on horse-back, and he let them wait at the gate<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e4132src" href="#xd31e4132">1</a>, lest it be closed. And he went on a fine horse, and passed before her house. She
had not been able to come yet because her mother watched her too carefully. He went
away to rejoin his friends. But that other was all worn out in the country, and could
no longer contain himself. He had mounted his horse. And his companion was unable
to persuade him to remain, and he did not want his company.
</p>
<p>That evening he arrived at the wall. All the gates were closed, but he went around
the town <span class="pageNum" id="pb209">[<a href="#pb209">209</a>]</span>until he chanced upon that gate where they were. He entered; he went towards her dwelling,
not with the hope of finding or of seeing her, but only to see the place. As he stopped
opposite the house, the other had but shortly before gone away. The girl unlocked
the gate, and called him in an undertone, and told him to draw his horse nearer. This
he was not slow in doing; he approached, and she leaped on the horse’s back, and away
they went.
</p>
<p>When they reached the gate, the other youth’s companions did not molest them, for
they did not know them. Seeing that if it had been he for whom they were waiting,
he would have stayed with them. They rode for well-nigh ten leagues, till they arrived
at a fair meadow surrounded with very tall fir-trees. Here they alighted, and bound
their horse to a tree; and he began to kiss her. Then she recognised him. She became
aware of her mishap, and commenced to weep bitterly. But he took to comforting her,
shedding tears, and showed her such respect, that she ceased to weep, and began to
grow fond of him, seeing that fortune too was on his side.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb210">[<a href="#pb210">210</a>]</span></p>
<p>And she embraced him.
</p>
<p>That other youth rode to and fro several times, till he heard her father making a
noise in the privy, and learned from the servant the manner of her escape.
</p>
<p>He was aghast.
</p>
<p>He returned to his companions, and told them. And they replied: Indeed, we did see
him pass with her, but we did not know him; and it is so long since, that he may have
gone very far, and be off on such and such a road. They forthwith set off to pursue
them. They rode until they found them sleeping wrapt in one another’s arms; and they
gazed upon them in the light of the moon which had risen. Then they were loath to
disturb them, and said: Let us wait here till they wake, and then we will do what
we have to do: and so they waited until drowsiness came upon them, and they all fell
asleep. The other two meanwhile awoke, and found themselves in this situation.
</p>
<p>They marvelled. And the youth said: These men have shown us such courtesy, that God
forbid we should do them any hurt. So he mounted <span class="pageNum" id="pb211">[<a href="#pb211">211</a>]</span>his horse, and she jumped on to another, among the best that were there, and they
rode off.
</p>
<p>The others awoke, and raised a great lamentation, because they could not continue
to search for them.

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
